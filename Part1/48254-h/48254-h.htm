<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>Outside of the province of the Märchen, which
constitutes so rich a field in German literature,
there is no writer better known or better loved in
the young German-speaking world than Johanna
Spyri. Her stories, written "for children and
those who love children," are read and reread as
something that never grows old. The secret of
this charm lies, above all, in the author's genuine
love of children, as shown in her sympathetic insight
into the joys, the hopes, and the longings of
childhood, and in her skillful selection of characteristic
details, which creates an atmosphere of reality
that is rare in books written for children.</p>

<p>Johanna Heusser Spyri was born in the little
Swiss town of Hirzel, canton of Zürich, in 1827,
and died in Zürich in 1901. She wrote especially
for young people, her writings dealing mostly with
Swiss mountain life and portraying the thrifty,
industrious nature of the people. The stories are
sometimes sad,&mdash;for the peasant's life is full of
hardships,&mdash;but through them all a fresh mountain
breeze is blowing and a play of sunlight illumines
the high Alps.</p>

<small>MONI IS HAPPY</small></h3>


<p>The baths of Fideris lie halfway up the mountain
side, overlooking the long valley of the Prättigau.
After you leave the highway and climb a long,
steep ascent, you come first upon the village of
Fideris, with its pleasant green slopes. Then,
ascending still higher into the mountains, you at
length come upon the lonely hotel building in the
midst of rocky cliffs and fir trees. Here the region
would indeed be rather dreary looking were it not
for the bright little mountain flowers that shine
forth everywhere from the low grass.</p>

<p>One pleasant summer evening two ladies stepped
out from the hotel and ascended the narrow footpath
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>that runs up steeply from the house to the rugged
cliffs above. On reaching the first peak the visitors
stopped and looked about, for they had but recently
come to the resort.</p>

<p>"Not very cheerful up here, is it, auntie?" said
the younger of the two, as she surveyed the scene.
"Nothing but rocks and fir trees, and beyond, more
rocks and firs. If we are to spend six weeks here,
I wish we might have some pleasanter prospect."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it would not add to your cheerfulness,
Paula, if you should lose your diamond pendant
up here," replied her aunt, as she fastened
Paula's velvet neck ribbon from which the sparkling
cross hung. "This is the third time I have tied it
since we came. I don't know whether the fault is
in yourself or in the ribbon, but I do know that
you would be sorry to lose it."</p>

<p>"No, no," cried Paula; "I must not lose the
cross! No, indeed! It is from grandmamma and
is my dearest treasure."</p>

<p>She added two or three knots to the ribbon herself
to make it secure. Suddenly she raised her
head attentively and exclaimed: "Listen, listen,
auntie! that sounds like something really jolly."</p>

<p>From far above came the notes of a merry song;
occasionally there was heard a long, echoing yodel,
then more singing. The ladies looked up, but no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
living creature was to be seen. The winding path,
turning in great curves between rocks and bushes,
was visible only in patches. But presently it seemed
all alive,&mdash;above, below, wherever parts of it could
be seen,&mdash;and louder and nearer came the singing.</p>

<p>"Look, look, auntie! There, there! see!" cried
Paula in great delight, as three, four, five goats
came bounding down, and behind them others and
still others, each one wearing a little tinkling bell.
Running along in their midst came the goat boy,
singing the last lines of his song:</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i-1">"The winter is cold,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But who would be sad?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For spring will return<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To make the world glad."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>With an echoing yodel the boy finished his song,
and skipping along meanwhile in his bare feet as
nimbly as his goats, he presently reached the side
of the ladies.</p>

<p>"Good evening to you," he said, looking up at
them with dancing eyes, and was about to go on.
But they liked this goat boy with the bright eyes.</p>

<p>"Wait a moment," said Paula. "Are you the
goat boy of Fideris? And are these the goats
from the village?"</p>

<p>"To be sure they are," he answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>"And do you take them up every day?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course."</p>

<p>"Indeed? And what is your name?"</p>

<p>"I am called Moni."</p>

<p>"Will you sing me the song you were just singing?
We heard only a few lines of it."</p>

<p>"It is too long," said Moni. "The goats shouldn't
be kept out so late; they must go home." Setting
his weathered little hat to rights, he flourished his
switch at the browsing goats and called, "Home,
home!"</p>

<p>"Then you will sing it for me some other time,
won't you, Moni?" cried Paula after him.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; good night!" he called back and
started on a trot with his goats. In a few moments
the whole flock had arrived at the outbuildings of
the hotel, where Moni had to leave the landlord's
goats, the pretty white one and the black one with
the dainty little kid. This little one Moni cared
for very tenderly, for it was a delicate little creature
and his favorite of them all. Little Meggy, in
turn, showed her affection for the boy by keeping
very close to him all day long. In the stable he
put her gently in her place, saying: "There, sleep
well, little Meggy; you must be tired. It's a long
trip for a little goat like you. But here is your
nice clean bed."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>After laying her down in the fresh straw he
started with his herd down the highway toward
the village. Presently he lifted his little horn to
his lips and blew a blast that resounded far down
the valley. At that the village children came
tumbling from their homes on all sides. Each one
recognizing his own goat made a rush for it and
took it home, while women, too, came out of the
near-by houses and led away their goats by neck
ropes or by the horns. In a few moments the whole
herd was dispersed and each goat was stabled in
its proper place. Moni was left with his own goat,
Brownie, and the two started off toward the little
house on the hillside, where grandmother was waiting
for them in the door.</p>

<p>"Has everything gone well, Moni?" she asked
in friendly tones, while she led Brownie into the
stable and began milking her. The old grandmother
was still a strong, vigorous woman, herself
performing all the duties of house and stable and
preserving the best of order everywhere. Moni
stood in the stable door and watched her. When
she had finished milking she went into the house
saying, "Come Moni; you must be hungry."</p>

<p>Everything was ready and Moni sat down to
eat; she sat beside him, and though the meal consisted
of but a simple dish of porridge stewed in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>goat's milk, it was a feast for the hungry boy.
Meanwhile he told grandmother what had happened
during the day; then, as soon as he had
finished his supper, he slipped off to bed, for at
early dawn he was to start out again with his flock.</p>

<p>In this way Moni had now spent two summers
and had grown so accustomed to this life and to the
companionship of his goats that he could hardly
think of any other existence for himself. He had
lived with his grandmother ever since he could
remember. His mother had died when he was a
tiny baby; his father had soon after left him to go
into military service in Naples. The grandmother
was herself poor, but she immediately took the forsaken
little boy, Solomon, into her own home and
shared with him whatever she had of food and other
goods. And, indeed, a blessing seemed to rest upon
the house from that day, for never since had she
suffered want.</p>

<p>Honest old Elsbeth was much respected in the
village, and when there had been a call two years
before for a new goat boy the choice fell unanimously
upon Moni, for every one was glad to help
the good woman along in this way. Not a single
morning had the God-fearing grandmother started
the boy off without reminding him: "Moni, do not
forget how close you are to God up there in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
mountains; how he sees and hears everything and
how you can hide nothing from his eyes. But remember,
too, that he is always near to help you,
so you need not fear; and if there is no one at
hand to help you in time of need, call upon God,
and his hand will not fail you."</p>

<p>So Moni had always gone forth trustfully to his
mountain heights, and on the loneliest peaks he
knew no fear, for he always thought, "The higher
up I go, the nearer I am to the good God and
therefore the safer in everything that may happen
to me." So, free from care, he could enjoy everything
about him from morning to night. No wonder,
then, that he sang and whistled and yodeled
all day long, for he must express his happiness
somehow.</p>

<small>MONI'S LIFE ON THE MOUNTAIN</small></h3>




<p>Next morning Paula awakened unusually early;
a lusty singing had roused her from sleep. "It
must be the goat boy," she said, jumping up and
running to the window.</p>

<p>Sure enough, there he stood with bright, shining
face; he had just taken the old goat and the
little kid out of the stable. Now he flourished his
switch, the goats skipped and ran about him, and
the whole procession started on. Presently Moni's
voice was again heard echoing from the hills:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i-1">"Up mid the pine trees<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The birds join in song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And though rain clouds may darken,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The sun's out erelong."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"This evening he must sing me the whole song,"
said Paula; for Moni had now disappeared and his
distant song could no longer be heard.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>
<p>Red morning clouds still hung in the sky and a
fresh mountain breeze was rustling about Moni's
ears as he climbed up the mountain. It was just
what he liked. He stopped on the first peak, and
for sheer happiness yodeled forth so lustily into
the valley that many a sleeper in the hotel opened
his eyes in surprise, but quickly closed them again,
for he recognized the voice and so knew that he
might have another hour's nap, as the goat boy
always came very early. Meanwhile Moni continued
climbing for an hour, higher and higher, up
to the rocky ledges.</p>

<p>The view grew wider and more beautiful the
higher he climbed. Occasionally he would stop to
look about him, across at the mountains and up to
the bright sky that was growing bluer and bluer,
and then he would sing out in a strong, happy voice:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>Now he had reached the spot where he usually
stayed and where he meant to rest for a while
to-day. It was a little green plateau standing out
from the mountain side, so that one might look
out from it in all directions and far down into the
valley. This projection was called the "Pulpit."
Here Moni would often sit for hours, looking out
over the surrounding country, whistling to himself,
while his goats were contentedly gathering herbs.</p>

<p>As soon as Moni had reached this spot he unstrapped
his lunch box from his back, laid it in a
little hollow which he had dug for it in the earth,
and then went out on the Pulpit, where he stretched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
out on the ground and gave himself up to the full
enjoyment of the hour. The sky was now dark
blue; on the opposite mountains ice fields and
sharp peaks had come to view, and far below the
green valley lay sparkling in the morning light.
Moni lay there, looking about him, singing and
whistling. The wind cooled his hot face, and when
his own notes ceased for a moment the birds overhead
whistled all the more merrily as they mounted
into the blue sky. Moni felt indescribably happy.
Now and then little Meggy would come to him and
rub her head against his shoulder in her affectionate
way, bleat tenderly, and then go to the other
side and rub against his other shoulder. The old
ones, too, would come up now and then and show
their friendship in their own particular fashion.</p>

<p>Brownie, his own goat, had a way of coming up
to him quite anxiously and looking him over very
carefully to see whether he was all right. She
would stand before him, waiting, until he said:
"Yes, yes, Brownie; it's all right. Go back to
your grazing now." Swallow, the slender, lively
little creature that darted to and fro like a swallow
in and out of its nest, always came up with the
young white one. The two would charge down
upon Moni with a force that would have overthrown
him had he not already been stretched flat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
on the ground. After a brief visit they would dart
off again as quickly as they had come.</p>

<p>The shiny black one, little Meggy's mother, who
belonged to the hotel, was rather proud. She
would stand off several feet from the boy, look at
him with a lofty air, as if afraid of seeming too
familiar, and then pass on her way. Sultan, the
big leader of the flock, in the one daily visit that he
paid would rudely push aside any other goat that
might be near, give several significant bleats,&mdash;probably
meant for reports on the condition of his
family,&mdash;and then turn away.</p>

<p>Little Meggy alone refused to be pushed away
from her protector. When Sultan came and tried
to thrust her aside, she would slip down as far as
she could under Moni's arm, and thus protected
she had no fear of the big buck, who was otherwise
so formidable to her.</p>

<p>Thus the sunshiny morning passed. Moni had
finished his noon lunch and was leaning meditatively
on the long cane which he always kept at hand for
difficult places. He was thinking about a new ascent,
for he meant to go up higher with the goats this
afternoon. The question was, which side should he
take, right or left? He chose the left, for there he
would come to the three "Dragon Rocks," about
which the tenderest, most luscious herbage grew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>The path was steep and there were dangerous
places along a precipitous wall, but he knew a good
road and the goats were sensible creatures and
would not easily run astray. He started and the
goats ran merrily along, now before him, now behind,
little Meggy always very close to him; sometimes
he picked her up and carried her over the
worst places. But all went well and they reached
the desired spot safely. The goats made a rush for
the green bushes, remembering the juicy shoots
they had enjoyed there before.</p>

<p>"Gently, gently!" Moni warned them. "Don't
butt one another along the steep places. You
might easily slide off and have your legs broken.
Swallow, Swallow, what are you about?" he called
out excitedly to the cliff above. The nimble goat
had scrambled over the high Dragon Rock and was
now standing on the outer edge of the cliff, looking
down saucily upon him. He hastily scrambled up
the cliff, meanwhile keeping an anxious eye upon
the goat, for a single misstep would have landed her
in the abyss below. Moni was agile and in a few
moments he had climbed the rock and, with a quick
movement, had grasped Swallow by the leg and
pulled her back. "You come with me now, you
foolish little beast," he said as he drew her down
to where the others were feeding. He held her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
for a while, until she was contentedly nibbling at
a tender shrub and had no more thoughts of
running away.</p>

<p>Suddenly Moni cried out, "Where is little
Meggy?" He saw the black mother standing alone
by a steep wall; she was not eating, but was looking
all about her and pointing her ears in a strange
manner. The little kid was always either beside
Moni or running after its mother.</p>

<p>"Where is your little one, Blackie?" he said,
standing close beside her and looking up and
down. Then he heard a faint, wailing bleat. It was
Meggy's voice and came from far below, piteous,
entreating. Moni got down on the ground and
leaned forward. Below him something seemed to
be moving; now he saw it plainly,&mdash;it was Meggy
hanging in the branches of a tree that grew out of
the rocks. She was wailing pitifully.</p>

<p>Luckily the branch had caught her, else she
would have fallen into the abyss and been dashed
to death. If she should even now lose her hold, she
must plunge instantly into the depths below. In
terror he called to her: "Hold fast, Meggy! hold
fast to the tree! I'm coming down to get you."</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="I017"></a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 50%" >
<img src="images/017.jpg" alt="Hold fast, Meggy!... I'm coming down to get you" style="width: 80%" />
</div>


<p>But how was he to get there? The rocks were
so steep at this point that he could not possibly
get down. But he reflected that he must be
somewhere near the "Rain Rock," that overhanging
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>cliff under which the goat boys had for generations
found shelter. From there, thought Moni, he might
climb across the rocks and so get back with the
kid. He quickly called the goats together and
took them to the entrance of the Rain Rock. There
he left them to graze and went out toward the
cliff. Some distance above him he saw the tree
with Meggy clinging to it.</p>

<p>He realized that it would be no easy matter to
climb up the cliff and then down again with Meggy
on his back, but there was no other way of rescuing
her. And then, too, he felt sure the dear
God would help him, so that he could not fall. He
folded his hands, looked up into heaven, and prayed,
"Dear God, please help me to save little Meggy."</p>

<p>Then he felt confident that all would go well and
he climbed bravely up the cliff until he reached the
tree. Here he held himself tight with both feet,
lifted the trembling, whining little creature to his
shoulders, and then worked his way down very
cautiously. When they had the solid ground once
more underfoot and he saw that the frightened
little goat was safe, he felt so glad that he had to
speak his thanks aloud, and he called up to heaven:
"Dear God, I thank you a thousand, thousand times
for helping us back safely. We are both so very,
very glad."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>He sat down on the ground for a while to caress
and quiet the little creature, that was still trembling
in every limb, until it had somewhat recovered from
its terrible experience.</p>

<p>When it was time, soon afterward, for breaking
up, Moni again lifted the kid to his shoulders, saying
solicitously: "Come, my poor little Meggy; you
are still trembling; you cannot walk home to-day;
I must carry you." And so he carried her, cuddled
close in his arm, all the way home.</p>

<p>Paula was standing on the ledge near the hotel,
waiting for the boy to pass. Her aunt was with
her. When Moni came along with his burden,
Paula wanted to know whether the little goat was
sick. She seemed so interested that Moni sat down
on the ground before her and told the whole story
about Meggy.</p>

<p>The young Fräulein showed great sympathy and
stooped to caress the little creature, that was now
lying quietly on Moni's knees, looking very pretty
with its little white feet and smooth black coat, and
evidently enjoying the girl's attention.</p>

<p>"Now sing me your song while you are resting
here so comfortably," said Paula.</p>

<p>Moni was so happy that he gladly complied with
her request, and sang the song through to a lusty
close.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>
<p>Paula was delighted with it and said he must
sing it for her often. Then the whole company
went on down to the hotel. There the little kid
was put to bed. Moni took his leave. Paula went
to her room and talked for a long time about the
goat boy, about his happy nature, his lonely life on
the mountain, and the joys and privations of such
a life. In this far-off, strange hotel there was little
diversion for the girl, and she was already looking
forward to the boy's happy morning song as one of
the pleasures of the morrow.</p>

<small>A VISIT</small></h3>




<p>Thus several days passed, each one as sunny and
bright as the one before it; for it was an unusually
fine summer, and from morning to night the sky
was blue and cloudless.</p>

<p>Every morning at early dawn the goat boy had
passed the hotel singing his merry song, and had
come back still singing at evening; and all the
guests were so accustomed to the cheerful sound
that they would have been sorry not to hear it.</p>

<p>But Paula, most of all, enjoyed Moni's happiness,
and went to meet him every evening, that she
might have a little talk with him.</p>

<p>One sunshiny morning Moni had again reached
the Pulpit and was just about to settle down upon
the ground when he reflected: "No, we'll go on
farther to-day. The last time we had to leave all the
good, juicy food because we went after little Meggy.
Now we'll go up again and you can finish grazing."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>Joyously the goats ran after him, for they understood
that they were being led to the fine feeding
on Dragon Rock. But this time Moni was careful
to hold little Meggy close in his arm all the way.
He picked the tenderest leaves and fed them to
her, and the little kid showed her appreciation by
rubbing her head against his arm and bleating contentedly
from time to time. So the morning passed
until Moni presently realized from his hunger that
it had grown surprisingly late. But his lunch was
in the little cave by the Pulpit, for he had intended
to be back there by noon.</p>

<p>"Now you have had many a good mouthful and
I have had nothing," he said to his goats. "It is
time I had something, too. Come, we'll go down;
there is enough left for you on the lower slope."</p>

<p>With that he whistled shrilly, and the whole
flock started downward, the liveliest ones in the
van; Swallow, the light-footed one,&mdash;for whom there
were unexpected things in store that day,&mdash;in advance
of them all. She jumped from rock to rock
and over many a chasm; but suddenly she could
go no farther, for directly in front of her stood a
chamois, looking her saucily in the face. Swallow
had never had such an experience before. She
stood still and looked questioningly at the stranger,
waiting for him to step aside and allow her to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
the fine jump she had in mind to the opposite rock.
But the chamois never moved, and stood staring
boldly into Swallow's face. So they faced each other,
getting more and more obstinate every moment;
they would probably be standing there to this day
had not Sultan come up at this point. Taking in
the situation, he carefully moved past Swallow and
pushed the stranger so forcibly to one side that he
had to make a quick jump to escape sliding off the
cliff. Then Swallow passed triumphantly on her way
and Sultan marched proudly behind her, feeling
himself to be the mighty protector of the herd.</p>

<p>Meanwhile another meeting was taking place.
Moni, coming from above, and another goat boy
from below, had met face to face and were looking
at each other in astonishment. But they were old
acquaintances and, after their first surprise, greeted
each other heartily. The newcomer was Jordie from
Kueblis. He had been looking for Moni half the
morning, and now found him where he least expected.</p>

<p>"I did not think you went up so high with the
goats," said Jordie.</p>

<p>"To be sure I do," answered Moni, "but not
always. I am generally somewhere near the Pulpit.
But why are you up here?"</p>

<p>"I wanted to see you; I have lots to tell you.
And these two goats here I am taking to the hotel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
keeper; he wants to buy one,&mdash;so I thought I'd
visit you on the way."</p>

<p>"Are they your goats?" asked Moni.</p>

<p>"Of course they are. I don't herd other people's
goats any longer. I'm not goat boy now."</p>

<p>Moni was surprised at this, for Jordie had started
out as goat boy of Kueblis at the same time that
he had been chosen from Fideris. He could not
understand how that could all be ended without
a sign of regret on Jordie's part.</p>

<p>But the boys had by this time reached the
Pulpit. Here Moni brought out his bread and
dried meat and invited Jordie to lunch. They sat
out on the Pulpit and ate their lunch with a relish,
for it had grown late and both were hungry. When
they had eaten everything and finished off with a
drink of goat's milk, Jordie stretched out full length
on the ground and leaned his head on his arms;
but Moni preferred to sit up and look out over
the great valley.</p>

<p>"But if you are no longer goat boy, Jordie, what
are you?" Moni began. "You must be something."</p>

<p>"Of course I am something,&mdash;something worth
while, you may believe," answered Jordie. "I am
egg boy. I go to the hotels with eggs every day.
I go up to the baths, too. Was there yesterday."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>


<p><a name="I025"></a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 50%" >
<img src="images/025.jpg" alt="He drew her close to him and held her fast" style="width: 80%" />
</div>




<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>
<p>Moni shook his head. "That wouldn't do for
me,&mdash;to be egg boy. No, I'd rather be goat boy,
a thousand times rather. That is much better."</p>

<p>"And why, I'd like to know?"</p>

<p>"Eggs aren't alive. You can't talk with them,
and they won't follow you like goats, and be glad
when you come, and love you, and understand every
word you say to them. You can't possibly enjoy
your eggs as I do my goats."</p>

<p>"Yes; great enjoyment you must have up here!"
said Jordie scornfully. "What pleasures do you
have? Since we've been sitting here you've had
to jump up six times to run after that silly little
goat, to keep her from falling over the rock. Is
that any pleasure?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I like it. You know that, Meggy, don't
you? Careful, careful!" he called, jumping up and
running after her, for in her joy she was capering
about most recklessly.</p>

<p>When he came back Jordie said, "Don't you
know that there is another way of keeping young
goats from falling over the cliffs, that will save
your running after them every few minutes?"</p>

<p>"How is that?" asked Moni.</p>

<p>"Drive a stake into the ground and tie the goat
to it by one leg; she will struggle desperately, but
she can't get away."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>"You don't really think that I would do such a
thing to little Meggy!" cried Moni indignantly,
while he drew her close to him and held her fast,
as though to defend her from such treatment.</p>

<p>"This little one, of course, won't bother you
much longer," Jordie went on. "There won't be
many more times for it to come up."</p>

<p>"What? what? What did you say, Jordie?"</p>

<p>"Pshaw! Don't you know that the landlord
doesn't mean to raise it? It is too weak; he
thinks it will never grow to be a strong goat. He
wanted to sell it to my father, but father did not
want it. So now he is going to kill it, and then he
will buy our Spottie."</p>

<p>Moni had grown white with horror. For a moment
he could not speak; then he broke forth in
a loud wail over the little goat: "No, no! they
shan't do it, my little Meggy; they shan't kill
you. I won't have it; I'd rather die with you!
No, no! I can't let them; I can't let them."</p>

<p>"Don't carry on so!" said Jordie, annoyed; and
he pulled Moni up from the ground, where he
had thrown himself, face downward, in his grief.
"Come, get up. You know the kid belongs to
the landlord and he can do with it as he pleases.
Don't think about it any more. Here, I have something
else. Look! look here!" and Jordie held out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
one hand toward Moni, while with the other he
almost covered something that he was offering for
Moni's admiration. It flashed out most wonderfully
from between his hands as the sun shone upon it.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Moni, seeing it sparkle.</p>

<p>"Guess!"</p>

<p>"A ring?"</p>

<p>"No; but something of the sort."</p>

<p>"Who gave it to you?"</p>

<p>"Gave it? Nobody. I found it."</p>

<p>"Then it doesn't belong to you, Jordie."</p>

<p>"Why not? I didn't steal it. I almost stepped
on it; then it would have been crushed anyway. So
I might as well have it."</p>

<p>"Where did you find it?"</p>

<p>"Down by the hotel last night."</p>

<p>"Then somebody in the house lost it; you must tell
the landlord. If you don't, I'll tell him this evening."</p>

<p>"No, no! you mustn't do that," cried Jordie.
"Look! I'll let you see it. I'm going to sell it to
a chambermaid in one of the hotels; but she must
give me at least four francs, and I will give you
one, or perhaps two, and no one shall know anything
about it."</p>

<p>"I don't want it! I don't want it!" Moni interrupted
angrily; "and God has heard every word
you said."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>Jordie looked up to heaven. "Too far away,"
he said doubtfully, but he took care to lower his
voice.</p>

<p>"He'll hear you, anyway," said Moni with
assurance.</p>

<p>Jordie began to feel uncomfortable. He must
get Moni over to his side or he would spoil the
whole game. Jordie thought and thought.</p>

<p>"Moni," he said suddenly, "I will promise you
something that will please you, if you won't tell
any one about what I found. And you needn't
take any of the money; then you won't have anything
to do with it. If you'll promise, then I will
persuade father to buy little Meggy, so that she
won't be killed. Will you?"</p>

<p>That started a hard struggle in Moni. It would
be sinful to conceal the finding of the treasure.
Jordie had opened his hand; there lay a cross set
with many jewels that sparkled with all colors.
Moni saw that it was no trifling thing that would
not be searched after. He felt that if he did not
tell it would be the same as though he himself were
keeping something that did not belong to him. But,
on the other hand, there was dear little Meggy;
she would be killed&mdash;horribly butchered with a
knife, and he could prevent it if he kept silent.
The little kid was at that moment lying trustfully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>beside him, as though she knew that he would always
protect her. No, he must not let such a thing happen;
he must do something to save her.</p>

<p>"Then I will, Jordie," he said, but without any
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Your hand on it!" and Jordie held out his own
hand, for thus a promise was made inviolable.</p>

<p>Jordie was very glad that he was now safe with
his treasure; but as Moni had grown so quiet, and
as he had a longer way home than Moni, he thought
it best to start on. He took leave of Moni and
whistled to his two goats, which had meanwhile
joined Moni's grazing flock,&mdash;not without various
buttings and other doubtful encounters, however;
for the goats of Fideris had never heard that one
must be polite to company, and the goats of Kueblis
did not know that when one is on a visit it is not
proper to pick out the best feeding for oneself
and push every one else away from it. When Jordie
was halfway down the mountain Moni, too, set out
with his flock, but he was very quiet and gave forth
not a note of song or whistle all the way home.</p>

<small>MONI CANNOT SING</small></h3>





<p>The next morning Moni came to the hotel as
quiet and downcast as he had been the evening
before. He came silently, took away the landlord's
goats, and then started on his upward journey,
without ever opening his lips for a song or
a yodel; he hung his head and looked as though
he were afraid of something. Now and then he cast
a furtive glance around to see if some one was not
following him.</p>

<p>Moni could not be happy any more; he could
hardly tell why. He felt that he ought to be glad
because he had saved little Meggy, and he tried to
sing, but he could not. The sun happened to be
clouded that day; he thought that when the sky
cleared he would feel quite different, and would be
happy again. When he got up on the mountain it
began to rain hard. Soon the rain came down in
torrents and he took refuge under the Rain Rock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>The goats, too, came and stood under the rock.
The proud black one, careful of her fine glossy coat,
had crept in even before Moni. She now lay behind
him, looking out contentedly from her comfortable
corner into the streaming rain. Meggy stood in front
of her protector and rubbed her head affectionately
against his knee, then looked up astonished to find
that he did not say a word to her, for that was most
extraordinary. His own brown goat, too, pawed at
his feet and bleated, for he had not spoken to her all
the morning. He sat there, leaning thoughtfully
on his cane, which he carried in rainy weather to
keep him from slipping on the rocks, for on such
days he wore shoes. To-day, as he sat for hours
under the rock, he had plenty of time for reflection.</p>

<p>He thought over what he had promised Jordie.
It seemed as though Jordie had stolen something
and he had done the same; for was not Jordie
going to give him something for it? He had at
any rate done what was wrong, and God was displeased
with him,&mdash;he felt that in his heart. He
was glad that it was dark and rainy, and that he
was hidden under the rock, for he would not dare
look up into the blue sky as he had formerly. He
was afraid now of the dear God.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="I033"></a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 50%" >
<img src="images/033.jpg" alt="He thought over what he had promised Jordie" style="width: 80%" />
</div>



<p>Other things, too, came into his mind. What if
Meggy should fall over a steep place again, and he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>should try to save her, and God would no longer
help him? What if he could never pray to him
any more, or have any hope of help from him?
And what if his feet should slip? Then he and
Meggy would fall down on the jagged rocks and
lie there all torn and mangled.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" he cried in his troubled heart; "this
cannot be." He must make his peace with the dear
God, so that he could pray once more and go to
him with all his troubles; then he could be happy
again. He would throw off the weight that was
upon him; he would go and tell the landlord everything.
But then? Then Jordie would not persuade
his father, and the landlord would have little
Meggy butchered. Oh, no, no, no! he could not
endure that; and he said: "No, I will not. I will
say nothing." But that did not relieve him; the
weight on his heart grew heavier and heavier.</p>

<p>So the whole day passed. He came home at
night as silent as he had gone forth in the morning;
and when Paula, waiting at the hotel, eagerly
ran out to him and asked sympathetically: "Moni,
what is the matter? Why don't you sing?" he
turned away embarrassed, saying, "Can't," and
went away as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>In their room upstairs Paula said to her aunt:
"If I only knew what is wrong with the goat boy!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
He is so changed I hardly know him. If he would
only sing again!"</p>

<p>"This wretched weather probably spoils the
boy's humor," said her aunt.</p>

<p>"Everything seems to be going wrong. Let us
go home, auntie," begged Paula. "Our good times
are over. First I lose my beautiful cross and there
is no trace of it anywhere; then this endless rain
sets in; and now there is not even the jolly goat
boy to listen to. Let us go home."</p>

<p>"But we must finish the treatment here. There
is no way out of it," said her aunt.</p>

<p>The next morning was again dark and cloudy and
the rain poured down without intermission. Moni
spent the day as he had the one before. He sat
under the rocks, his thoughts going round and
round in the same circle. Whenever he reached
the resolution, "Now I will go and confess the
wrong, so that I can look up to God once more,"
he saw the little goat under the butcher's knife,
and the whole struggle began again from the
beginning; so that he was quite worn out when
evening came, and went crawling home through
the drenching rain as though he hardly noticed it.</p>

<p>As he passed the hotel the landlord called to him:
"Can't you get along a little faster? Look how wet
they are. What's come over you, anyway, lately?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>Such cross words had never been addressed to
him before by the landlord. On the contrary, the
latter had always shown special friendliness to the
boy; but now he was irritated by Moni's altered
manner, and was in bad humor otherwise, for
Paula had told him about her missing jewel, which
she declared could have been lost only within the
hotel or directly before the door, for she had left
the house on that day only to listen to the goat
boy's song. To have it said that so valuable an
article could be lost in his house, and not be returned,
annoyed the landlord extremely. On the
previous day he had summoned the whole staff of
servants, had examined them, threatened them, and
had finally offered a reward to the finder. The
whole establishment was upset by the occurrence.</p>

<p>When Moni passed the front of the hotel Paula
was there waiting for him, wondering why he had
not yet found his song.</p>

<p>"Moni, Moni!" she called; "are you really the
same boy who used to come by here singing from
morning to night,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i-1">'And the sky is so blue<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I am wild with delight'?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Moni heard the words and they made a deep
impression on him, but he gave no answer. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
felt that it had indeed been different when he went
about singing all day, with a spirit as happy as his
song. Would such days ever come again?</p>

<p>The next morning he climbed the mountain sad
and silent as the day before. The rain had stopped,
but a heavy mist hung over the mountains, and the
sky was covered with dark clouds. Moni sat under the
rocks, tortured with distressing thoughts. Toward
noon the sky began to clear. It grew brighter and
brighter, and Moni came out of the cave and looked
about. The goats were gayly skipping about once
more, the little kid wantonly capering in the sunshine.</p>

<p>Moni stood out on the Pulpit watching the sky
and the mountains as they came out brighter and
brighter. When the clouds parted and the blue
heavens shone forth, it seemed to Moni as though
the dear God were looking down on him from
heaven. Suddenly things within him seemed to
grow very clear, and he knew what he must do.
He could not carry the wrong about in his heart any
longer; he felt that he must cast it off. Then
he seized the frolicsome little kid, took it in his
arms, and said tenderly: "O my Meggy, my poor
little Meggy! I have surely done what I could; but
it was sinful and bad. Now you must die. Oh,
oh! how can I endure it!" And he began to cry so
bitterly that he could say no more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>The little kid uttered a sad cry and crept as far
under his arm as she could, as though to hide and
be safe with him. He lifted her to his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Come, Meggy," he said; "I'll carry you home
once more. Perhaps soon I shall not have you to
carry."</p>

<p>When the company reached the hotel Paula was
again waiting. Moni left the little kid and the old
black mother in the stable. Then, instead of going
on down, he came to the house and was about to
go in, when the Fräulein stopped him.</p>

<p>"Haven't you found your song yet, Moni?
Where are you going with that look of woe?"</p>

<p>"I have something to report," answered Moni,
without raising his eyes.</p>

<p>"To report? What is it? Won't you tell me?"</p>

<p>"I must see the landlord. Something was
found."</p>

<p>"Found? What? I lost something,&mdash;a beautiful
cross."</p>

<p>"That is it."</p>

<p>"What did you say?" cried Paula, in greatest
astonishment. "A cross with sparkling stones?"</p>

<p>"Yes, exactly."</p>

<p>"Where is it, Moni? Give it to me. Did you
find it?"</p>

<p>"No; Jordie of Kueblis did."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>Paula wanted to know who Jordie was and where
he lived, and was about to send some one down to
Kueblis right away to get the cross.</p>

<p>"I will go; and if he still has the cross, I will
bring it," said Moni.</p>

<p>"If he still has it!" cried Paula. "Why should
he not have it? and how do you know all about
this, Moni? When did he find it, and how did you
hear about it?"</p>

<p>Moni stared at the ground; he dared not tell
how it had all happened and how he had helped
to hide the discovery until he had been forced to
speak.</p>

<p>But Paula was very kind to him. She led him
aside, sat down on a tree stump with him, and said
reassuringly: "Come, tell me how it happened,
Moni. I want you to tell me all about it."</p>

<p>So Moni took courage and began. He told the
whole story,&mdash;all about his struggles for Meggy's
sake; how he had grown so miserable through it
all and dared not look up to God; and how he
had not been able to endure it longer and had
resolved to tell.</p>

<p>Then Paula gave him friendly advice and said he
ought to have come at once and reported, but it
was right that he had now told her everything
so frankly, and he would not regret it. She said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
he might promise Jordie ten francs as soon as she
had the cross in her possession once more.</p>

<p>"Ten francs!" repeated Moni in surprise, remembering
how Jordie had wanted to sell it.
Then he rose. He would go back to Kueblis that
very night, and if he got the cross, bring it back
to-morrow morning. Then he ran away, realizing as
he went that he could skip and jump once more, and
that the heavy burden was no longer on his heart.</p>

<p>On reaching home he merely told his grandmother
that he had an errand in Kueblis, and at
once started off. He found Jordie at home and
told him what he had done. Jordie was quite angry
with him for a moment, but when he reflected
that further concealment was now impossible he
brought out the cross, asking, "What is she going
to give me for it?"</p>

<p>Moni was ready with his answer: "Ten francs.
You see honest dealing would have paid you best,
for with your dishonesty you expected to get only
four francs; but you will get your money."</p>

<p>Jordie was surprised, and regretted that he had
not gone to the hotel at once with the cross, and so
come off with a clear conscience, which he certainly
had not now. Things might have been quite different,
but it was too late. He gave the cross to Moni,
who hurried home, as it had grown quite dark.</p>

<small>MONI SINGS ONCE MORE</small></h3>



<p>Paula had left orders that she was to be called
early in the morning. She wanted to be on hand
when the goat boy came, and settle with him herself.
The previous evening she had had a long
interview with the landlord, coming away from his
room with a look of satisfaction, as though she had
made some pleasant arrangement with him.</p>

<p>When Moni came up with his herd in the morning
Paula called to him, "Moni, can't you sing
even now?"</p>

<p>He shook his head. "I can't. I keep thinking
of poor little Meggy and how many days longer
she will be with me. I'll never sing again as long
as I live; but here is the cross." With that he
gave her the parcel, which his grandmother had
carefully done up for him in many wrappings.</p>

<p>Paula took the jewel from its coverings and
examined it closely; it was really her precious
cross of sparkling stones, perfectly unharmed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, Moni, you have made me very happy.
Without you I should probably never have seen my
cross again. So I want to make you happy, too. Go
and get little Meggy; she belongs to you now."</p>

<p>Moni stared at the Fräulein as though he could not
comprehend her words. At length he stammered,
"But how&mdash;how can Meggy belong to me?"</p>

<p>"How?" said Paula, smiling. "Last night I
bought her from the landlord, and to-day I give
her to you. Can you sing now?"</p>

<p>"Oh! oh! oh!" cried Moni, running to the
stable like mad. He took the little goat and held
her close in his arms. Then he came running
back and held out his hand to the Fräulein, saying
over and over again, "I thank you a thousand,
thousand times! God reward you for it! If I
could only do something for you!"</p>

<p>"Then sing your song and let us hear whether
it has the old ring," said Paula.</p>

<p>So Moni lifted up his voice, and as he climbed
the mountain his joyous notes rang out so clearly
through the valley that every one in the hotel
noticed it, and many a sleeper turned on his pillow,
saying, "Good! the goat boy has sunshine once
more."</p>

<p>They were all glad to hear him sing again, for
they liked the early notes, which were to some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
a sign for rising, to others leave for another nap.
When Moni looked down from the first ledge and
saw the Fräulein still standing before the hotel, he
stepped forward and sang as loudly as he could:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i-1">"And the sky is so blue<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I am wild with delight."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Nothing but sounds of joy came from his lips all
day, and the goats, too, seemed to feel that it was
a day of gladness, and skipped and capered about as
never before. The sun was so bright, the sky so
blue, and after the heavy rains the grasses so green
and the flowers so gay, that Moni thought he had
never seen the world so beautiful. He kept his little
kid beside him all day, plucked the best herbs for it,
and fed it from his hand, saying again and again:
"Meggy, dear little Meggy, you are not going to
be killed. You are mine now, and will come up the
mountain with me as long as we both live."</p>

<p>With happy song and yodel Moni returned in
the evening, and after he had led the black goat
to her stable he took the little one on his arm;
she was henceforth to go home with him. Meggy
seemed very well satisfied, and cuddled up to him
as though she felt herself in the best of care; for
he had always treated her more tenderly than her
own mother had.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>When Moni came home with the little one on his
shoulder his grandmother hardly knew what to make
of him. His calling out, "It is mine, grandmother; it
is mine!" explained nothing to her. But Moni could
not stop to explain until he had run to the stable and
made a good bed for Meggy close beside their own
goat, so that the little one would not be lonely.</p>

<p>"There, Meggy; now sleep well in your new
home. You shall always have a good bed. I will
make it fresh for you every day."</p>

<p>Then Moni ran in to the wondering grandmother,
and while they sat at supper he told her
the whole story,&mdash;of his three sad, troubled days
and the happy ending of it all. His grandmother
listened attentively, and when he had finished she
said earnestly: "Moni, this experience you must
always remember. Had you done right in the first
place, trusting in the good God, then everything
would have gone well. Now God has helped you
so much more than you deserve that you must not
forget it as long as you live." And Moni was very
sure that he would not forget.</p>

<p>Before he went to sleep he had to go to the
stable once more to make sure that the little kid
really belonged to him and was there in its bed.</p>

<p>Jordie got his ten francs, as promised, but that
did not end the matter for him. When he went to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>the hotel he was taken before the landlord, who
gave him a severe lecture. But the worst of it all
was that whenever anything was missed after that,
it was Jordie who was immediately suspected of
having stolen it. He had no more peace, for he
was continually in dread of being punished for
something that he had never done.</p>

<p>Moni's little goat throve and grew strong, and
the boy continued to sing all summer. But often
when he was comfortably stretched out on the
Pulpit, he thought of the troubled days under the
Rain Rock, and he said to himself, "It must never
happen so again."</p>

<p>But when he was too long absorbed in such
reflections one or another of the goats would come
and rouse him with a questioning bleat.</p>

<small>HE IS GOOD FOR NOTHING</small></h3>





<p>The traveler who ascends Mt. Seelis from the
rear will presently find himself coming out upon
a spot where a green meadow, fresh and vivid, is
spread out upon the mountain side. The place
is so inviting that one feels tempted to join the
peacefully grazing cows and fall to eating the soft
green grass with them. The clean, well-fed cattle
wander about with pleasant musical accompaniment;
for each cow wears a bell, so that one may
tell by the sound whether any of them are straying
too far out toward the edge, where the precipice
is hidden by bushes and where a single misstep
would be fatal. There is a company of boys, to be
sure, to watch the cows, but the bells are also necessary,
and their tinkling is so pleasant to hear that
it would be a pity not to have them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>Little wooden houses dot the mountain side, and
here and there a turbulent stream comes tumbling
down the slope. Not one of the cottages stands on
level ground; it seems as though they had somehow
been thrown against the mountain and had
stuck there, for it would be hard to conceive of
their being built on this steep slope. From the
highway below you might think them all equally
neat and cheery, with their open galleries and little
wooden stairways, but when you came nearer to
them you would notice that they differed very
much in character.</p>

<p>The two first ones were not at all alike. The
distance between them was not very great, yet they
stood quite apart, for the largest stream of the
neighborhood, Clear Brook, as it is called, rushed
down between them. In the first cottage all the
little windows were kept tightly closed even through
the finest summer days, and no fresh air was ever let
in except through the broken windowpanes, and
that was little enough, for the holes had been
pasted over with paper to keep out the winter's
cold. The steps of the outside stairway were in
many places broken away, and the gallery was in
such a ruinous state that it seemed as though the
many little children crawling and stumbling about
on it must surely break their arms or legs. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
they all were sound enough in body though very
dirty; their faces were covered with grime and
their hair had never been touched by a comb.
Four of these little urchins scrambled about here
through the day, and at evening they were joined
by four older ones,&mdash;three sturdy boys and a girl,&mdash;who
were at work during the day. These, too,
were none too clean, but they looked a little better
than the younger ones, for they could at least wash
themselves.</p>

<p>The little house across the stream had quite a
different air. Even before you reached the steps,
everything looked so clean and tidy that you thought
the very ground must be different from that across
the stream. The steps always looked as though
they had just been scrubbed, and on the gallery
there were three pots of blooming pinks that wafted
fragrance through the windows all summer long.
One of the bright little windows stood open to let
in the fresh mountain air, and within the room a
woman might be seen, still strong and active in
spite of the snowy white hair under her neat black
cap. She was often at work mending a man's shirt,
that was stout and coarse in material but was
always washed with great care.</p>

<p>The woman herself looked so trim and neat in
her simple dress that one fancied she had never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
in her life touched anything unclean. It was Frau
Vincenze, mother of the young herdsman Franz
Martin, he of the smiling face and strong arm.
Franz Martin lived in his little hut on the mountain
all summer making cheese, and returned to his
mother's cottage only in the late fall, to spend the
winter with her and make butter in the lower dairy
hut near by.</p>

<p>As there was no bridge across the wild stream,
the two cottages were quite separated, and there
were other people much farther away whom Frau
Vincenze knew better than these neighbors right
across the brook; for she seldom looked over at
them,&mdash;the sight was not agreeable to her. She
would shake her head disapprovingly when she saw
the black faces and dirty rags on the children, while
the stream of fresh, clean water ran so near their
door. She preferred, when the twilight rest hour
came, to enjoy her red carnations on the gallery,
or to look down over the green slope that stretched
from her cottage to the valley below.</p>

<p>The neglected children across the stream belonged
to "Poor Grass Joe," as he was called, who
was usually employed away from home in haying,
or chopping wood, or carrying burdens up the
mountain. The wife had much to do at home, to
be sure, but she seemed to take it for granted that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
so many children could not possibly be kept in
order, and that in time, when the children grew
older, things would mend of their own accord. So
she let everything go as it would, and in the fresh,
pure air the children remained healthy and were
happy enough scrambling around on the steps and
on the ground.</p>

<p>In the summer time the four older ones were out
all day herding cows; for here in the lower pasture
the whole herd of cows was not left to graze under
one or two boys, as on the high Alps, but each
farmer had to hire his own herd boy to look after
his cows. This made jolly times for the boys and
girls, who spent the long days together playing
pranks and making merry in the broad green fields.
Sometimes Joe's children were hired for potato
weeding farther down the valley, or for other light
field work. Thus they earned their living through
the summer and brought home many a penny
besides, which their mother could turn to good
account; for there were always the four little
mouths to be fed and clothes to be got for all the
children. However simple these clothes might be,
each child must have at least a little shirt, and the
older ones one other garment besides. The family
was too poor to possess even a cow, though
there was scarcely a farmer in the neighborhood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
who did not own one, however small his piece of
land might be.</p>

<p>Poor Grass Joe had got his name from the
fact that the spears of grass on his land were so
scarce that they would not support so much as a
cow. He had only a goat and a potato field. With
these small resources the wife had to struggle
through the summer and provide for the four little
ones, and sometimes, when work was scarce, for one
or two of the older ones also. The father occasionally
came home in the winter, but he brought
very little to his family, for his house and land
were so heavily mortgaged that he was never out
of debt throughout the whole year. Whenever he
had earned a little money, some one whom he owed
would come and take it all away.</p>

<p>So the wife had a hard time to get along,&mdash;all the
more so because she had no order in her house-keeping
and was not skillful in any kind of work.
She would often go out and stand on the tumbledown
gallery, where the boards were lying loose
and ready to drop off, and instead of taking a hammer
and fastening them down would look across
the stream at the neat little cottage with the bright
windows, and would say fretfully, "Yes, it's all very
well for her to clean and scrub,&mdash;she has nothing
else to do; but with me it's quite different."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>Then she would turn back angrily into the close,
dingy room and vent her anger on the first person
who crossed her path. This usually happened to
be a boy of ten or eleven years, who was not her
own child, but who had lived in her house ever
since he was a baby. This little fellow, known only
by the name of "Stupid Rudi," was so lean and
gaunt looking that one would have taken him to be
scarcely eight years old. His timid, shrinking manner
made it difficult to tell what kind of a looking
boy he really was, for he never took his eyes from
the ground when any one spoke to him.</p>

<p>Rudi had never known a mother; she had died
when he was hardly two years old, and shortly
afterward his father had met with an accident when
returning from the mountain one evening. He had
been wild haying, and, seeking to reach home by
a short cut, had lost his footing and fallen over a
precipice. The fall lamed him, and after that he
was not fit for any other work but braiding mats,
which he sold in the big hotel on Mt. Seelis. Little
Rudi never saw his father otherwise than sitting
on a low stool with a straw mat on his knees.
"Lame Rudolph" was the name the man went by.
Now he had been dead six years. After his wife's
death he had rented a little corner in Joe's house
for himself and boy to sleep in, and the little fellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
had remained there ever since. The few pennies
paid by the community for Rudi's support were
very acceptable to Joe's wife, and the extra space
in his bedroom, after the father's death, was eagerly
seized for two of her own boys, who had scarcely
had sleeping room for some time.</p>

<p>Rudi had been by nature a shy, quiet little fellow.
The father, after the loss of his wife and the
added misfortune of being crippled, lost all spirit;
little as he had been given to talking before his
misfortune, he was even more silent afterward.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="I057"></a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 50%" >
<img src="images/057.jpg" alt="He would hunt up a hedge or a bush and hide behind it" style="width: 80%" />
</div>


<p>So little Rudi would sit beside his father for
whole days without hearing a word spoken, and
did not himself learn to speak for a long time.
After his father died and he belonged altogether
to Joe's household, he hardly ever spoke at all.
He was scolded and pushed about by everybody,
but he never thought of resisting; it was not in
his nature to fight. The children did what they
pleased to him, and besides their abuse he had to
bear the woman's scoldings, especially when she
was in a bad temper about the neat little house
across the stream. But Rudi did not rebel, for he
had the feeling that the whole world was against
him, so what good would it do? With all this the
boy in time grew so shy that it seemed as though
he hardly noticed what was going on about him,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>and he usually gave no answer when any one spoke
to him. He seemed, in fact, to be always looking
for some hole that he might crawl into, where he
would never be found again.</p>

<p>So it had come about that the older children,
Jopp, Hans, Uli, and the girl Lisi, often said to
him, "What a stupid Rudi you are!" and the four
little ones began saying it as soon as they could
talk. As Rudi never tried to deny it, all the people
in time assumed that it must be so, and he was
known throughout the neighborhood simply as "Stupid
Rudi." And it really seemed as though the boy
could not attend to anything properly as the other
children did. If he was sent along with the other
boys to herd cows, he would immediately hunt up a
hedge or a bush and hide behind it. There he would
sit trembling with fear, for he could hear the other
boys hunting him and calling to him to come and
join their game. The games always ended with
a great deal of thumping and thrashing, of which
Rudi invariably got the worst, because he would
not defend himself, and, in fact, could not defend
himself against the many stronger boys. So he
crept away and hid as quickly as he could; meanwhile
his cows wandered where they pleased and
grazed on the neighbors' fields. This was sure to
make trouble, and all agreed that Rudi was too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
stupid even to herd cows, and no one would engage
him any more. In the field work there was the
same trouble. When the boys were hired to weed
potatoes they thought it great fun to pelt each
other with bunches of potato blossoms,&mdash;it made
the time pass more quickly,&mdash;and of course each
one paid back generously what he got. Rudi alone
gave back nothing, but looked about anxiously in
all directions to see who had hit him. That was
exactly what amused the other boys; and so, amid
shouts and laughter, he was pelted from all sides,&mdash;on
his head, his back, or wherever the balls might
strike. But while the others had time to work in
the intervals, Rudi did nothing but dodge and hide
behind the potato bushes. So at this work he was
a failure, too, and young and old agreed that Rudi
was too stupid for any kind of work, and that Rudi
would never amount to anything. As he could earn
nothing and would never amount to anything, he
was treated accordingly by Joe's wife. Her own
four little ones had hardly enough to eat, and so it
usually happened that for Rudi there was nothing
at all and he was told, "You can find something;
you are old enough."</p>

<p>How he really existed no one knew, not even Joe's
wife; yet he had always managed somehow. He
never begged; he would not do that; but many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
a good woman would hand out a piece of bread
or a potato to the poor, starved little fellow as he
went stealing by her door, not venturing to look
up, much less to ask for anything. He had never
in his life had enough to eat, but still that was not
so hard for him as the persecution and derision he
had to take from the other boys. As he grew older
he became more and more sensitive to their ridicule,
and his main thought at all times was to escape
notice as much as possible. As he was never seen
to take any part with the other children in work or
play, people took it for granted that he was incapable
of doing what the others did, and they declared
that he was growing more stupid from day
to day.</p>

<h3 class="no-break">CHAPTER II<br />
<small>IN THE UPPER PASTURE</small></h3>





<p>On a pleasant summer afternoon when the flies
were dancing gayly in the sun, all the boys and girls
of the Hillside were running about so excitedly that
it was evident there was something particular on
hand for that day. Jopp, the oldest one of them
all, was leader of the assembly, and when all the
company had come together he announced that they
would now go to the dairy hut in the upper pasture,
for this was the day for a "cheese party." But
first of all they must decide who was to stay below
and watch the cows while the others went to the
party. That was, of course, a difficult question, for
no one was inclined to sacrifice himself for the sake
of the others and stay behind. Uli suggested that
they might for once make Rudi take care of the
cows, and in order to keep him mindful of his duties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
they had best thrash him beforehand. His suggestion
met with approval, and some of the leaders
were already starting off to find the victim, when
Lisi's voice was heard shrilly screaming above the
others: "I think Uli's notion is a very stupid one,
for we'll all have to pay for it when we come home
and find the cows strayed off. You don't suppose
that if Rudi is too stupid to watch two cows he
would suddenly be smart enough to take care of
twenty! We must draw lots and three of us must
stay here with the cows. That's the only way."</p>

<p>Lisi's argument was convincing. The company
took her advice, and three of the number were
sentenced to stay behind, Uli himself being one of
those upon whom the unhappy lot fell. Mumbling
and grumbling he turned his back upon the exultant
throng and sat down upon the ground,&mdash;the
other two beside him,&mdash;while the rest, with
shouts and laughter, went scampering up the mountain,
wild with expectation.</p>

<p>The boys were always notified by Franz Martin
of the coming of cheese day, and they, in turn,
never failed to remind him if they thought he might
forget, for it was a gala occasion to them. It was
the day when Franz Martin trimmed his fresh
cheeses, after these had been pressed, a soft mass,
into the round wooden forms. When the weight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
was laid upon it some of the cheesy mass would be
pressed out from the edge of the mold in the form
of a long, snow-white sausage. This was trimmed
off, broken into pieces, and distributed among the
children by the good-natured dairyman. The festival
of cheese distribution occurred every two weeks
throughout the summer and was hailed each time
with loud expressions of joy.</p>

<p>While the children were settling their plans Rudi
had been hiding behind a big thistle bush. He kept
very quiet and did not move until he heard the whole
company racing up the mountain; then he looked
out very cautiously. The three who had been blackballed
sat sulking on the ground with their backs
toward him. The others were some distance up
the mountain; their shouting and yodeling rang out
merrily from above. Rudi, hearing their shouts,
was suddenly seized with an overwhelming desire
to join the cheese party. He stole out from behind
the bush, cast a swift glance over toward the three
grumblers, and then, softly and lightly as a weasel,
slipped up the mountain side.</p>

<p>After scrambling up the last steep ascent he
came upon a little fresh green plateau, and there
stood the dairy hut; close beside it Clear Brook
went tumbling down the slope. In the door of his
hut stood Franz Martin with round, smiling face,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
laughing at the strange capers that the boys and
girls were making in their efforts to get to the
feast. They had all reached the hut and were
pushing one another forward in order to be as
close as possible when the distribution should
begin.</p>

<p>"Gently, gently," laughed Franz Martin; "if
you all crowd into the hut, I shall have no room to
cut the cheese, and that will be your loss."</p>

<p>Then he took a stout knife and went to the
great round cheese that he had ready on the table.
He trimmed it off quickly and came out with a long,
snow-white roll, and, breaking off pieces from it,
passed them about here and there, sometimes over
the heads of the taller ones to the little fellows
who could not push forward,&mdash;for Franz Martin
wanted to be just and fair in his distribution.</p>

<p>Rudi had been standing in the outermost row,
and when he tried to push forward he got a thump
now on one side and now on the other. So he ran
from side to side; but Franz Martin did not see
him at all, because some bigger, stouter boy always
crowded in ahead of him. Finally he got such a
fierce blow from big, burly Jopp that he was flung
far off to one side, almost turning a somersault before
he got his footing. He saw that the distribution
was almost at an end and that he was not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
get even a tiny bit of cheese roll, so he did not propose
to get any more thumps. He went off by
himself down the slope, where some young fir trees
stood, and sat down under them. On the tallest of
these trees a little bird was whistling forth gayly into
the bright heavens, as though there were nothing
else in the world but blue skies and sunshine.</p>

<p>Rudi, listening to the glad song, almost forgot
his troubles of a moment ago; but he could not
help looking over occasionally to the hut, where
the shouting and laughter continued as the children
chased each other about, trying to snatch
pieces of cheese from each other. When Rudi saw
them biting off delicious mouthfuls of the snowy
mass, he would sigh and say to himself, "Oh, if I
could only have a little taste!" for he had never
had a single bite of cheese roll; never before had
he even ventured so far as to join a party. But it
availed him nothing, even if he summoned forth all
his courage, as he had to-day, and so he came to the
melancholy conclusion that he would never in his
life get a taste of cheese roll. The thought was so
disheartening to him that he no longer heard the
song of the little bird, but sat under the bushes
quite hopeless.</p>

<p>Now the feast at the hut was ended and the
revelers came down the slope with a rush, each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
one trying to get ahead of the others, their eagerness
leading to many a roll and tumble down the
steep places. As Hans went shouting past the
group of fir trees he discovered Rudi half hidden
under them.</p>

<p>"Come out of there, old mole! You must play
with us!" he shouted; and Rudi understood what
he was expected to "play" with them.</p>

<p>He was to stand as block, so that the others
might jump over him. He was usually knocked
over at every jump, and he would much rather
have stayed in his little retreat; but he knew what
was in store for him if he did not follow their commands,
so he came out obediently.</p>

<p>"How much cheese roll did you get?" Hans
yelled at him.</p>

<p>"None," answered Rudi.</p>

<p>"What a simpleton!" yelled Hans still louder.
"He comes up here expressly to get cheese roll,
and then he goes away without any!"</p>

<p>"You stupid Rudi!" they shouted at him from
all sides, and the big boys began jumping over him,
so that he had hard work getting on his feet as fast
as they knocked him over. Sometimes he would
roll down the hill with a whole clump of them, and
they would all continue rolling until some chance
obstacle brought them to their feet once more.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
After their boisterous descent they all ran in different
directions, each one to seek his own cows.
Rudi ran off by himself, far away from them all,
for now he expected even worse treatment from
the three unfortunates, because he had deserted
them. He slipped down the hill to the swamp hole,
and crouched down so that he could not be seen
from above or below.</p>

<p>The swamp hole was a hollow where water gathered
in spring and fall and made the ground swampy.
Now it was quite dry,&mdash;a pleasant spot, where
fine, dark red strawberries ripened in the warm sun
that beat against the side of the hollow. But Rudi
trembled as long as he was in the neighborhood of
houses and herd boys, for the latter might discover
him at any moment and renew their persecutions.
He sat there trembling at every sound, for he kept
thinking, "Now they are coming after me." Suddenly
he was filled with a delightful memory of the
little nook under the fir trees and of the whistling
bird overhead. He felt irresistibly drawn to it; he
must go back to that spot.</p>

<p>He ran with all his might up the mountain, never
stopping once until he had reached the group of trees
and had slipped in under them. The only opening
in this retreat was on the outer side, toward the
valley, so he felt safely hidden. All around him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
was great silence; no sound came up from below;
only the little bird was still whistling its merry tune.
The sun was setting; the high snow peaks began
to glimmer and to glow, and over the whole green
alp lay the golden evening light. Rudi looked about
him in silent wonder; an unknown feeling of security
and comfort came over him. Here he was safe; there
was no one to be seen or heard in any direction.</p>

<p>He sat there a long time and would have liked
never to go away again, for he had never felt so
happy in his life. But he heard heavy steps coming
from the hut behind him. It was the herdsman;
he was coming along carrying a small bucket; he
was probably going to the stream to fetch water.
Rudi tried to be as quiet as a mouse, for he was so
used to having every one scold and ridicule him that
he thought the herdsman would do the same, or at
least would drive him away. He huddled down under
the bushes; but the branches crackled. Franz
Martin listened, then came over and looked under
the fir trees.</p>

<p>"What are you doing in there, half buried in the
ground?" asked the herdsman with smiling face.</p>

<p>"Nothing," answered Rudi in a faint voice that
trembled with fear.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>


<p><a name="I069"></a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 50%" >
<img src="images/069.jpg" alt="Come out, child! You need not be afraid" style="width: 80%" />
</div>



<p>"Come out, child! You need not be afraid, if
you have done nothing wrong. Why are you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>hiding? Did you creep in here with your cheese
roll so that you could eat it in peace?"</p>

<p>"No; I had no cheese roll," said Rudi, still
trembling.</p>

<p>"You didn't? and why not?" asked the herdsman
in a tone of voice that no one had ever used
toward Rudi before, arousing an altogether new
feeling in him,&mdash;trust in a human being.</p>

<p>"They pushed me away," he answered, as he
arose from his hiding place.</p>

<p>"There, now," continued the friendly herdsman;
"I can at least see you. Come a little nearer. And
why don't you defend yourself when they push you
away? They all push each other, but every one
manages to get a turn, and why not you?"</p>

<p>"They are stronger," said Rudi, so convincingly
that Franz Martin could offer no further argument
in the matter. He now got a good look at the boy,
who stood before the stalwart herdsman like a little
stick before a great pine tree. The strong man
looked down pityingly at the meager little figure, that
seemed actually mere skin and bones; out of the
pale, pinched face two big eyes looked up timidly.</p>

<p>"Whose boy are you?" asked the herdsman.</p>

<p>"Nobody's," was the answer.</p>

<p>"But you must have a home somewhere. Where
do you live?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>"With Poor Grass Joe."</p>

<p>Franz Martin began to understand. "Ah! so
you are that one," he said, as if remembering something;
for he had often heard of Stupid Rudi, who
was of no use to anybody, and was too dull even to
herd a cow.</p>

<p>"Come along with me," he said sympathetically;
"if you live with Joe, no wonder you look like a
little spear of grass yourself. Come! the cheese
roll is all gone, but we'll find something else."</p>

<p>Rudi hardly knew what was happening to him.
He followed after Franz Martin because he had
been told to, but it seemed as though he were
going to some pleasure, and that was something
altogether new to him. Franz Martin went into
the hut, and taking down a round loaf of bread
from an upper shelf, he cut a big slice across the
whole loaf. Then he went to the huge ball of
butter, shining like a lump of gold in the corner,
and hacked off a generous piece. This he spread
over the bread and then handed the thickly buttered
slice to Rudi. Never in all his life had
the boy had anything like it. He looked at it as
though it could not possibly belong to him.</p>

<p>"Come outside and eat it; I must go for water,"
said Franz Martin, while he watched with twinkling
eyes the expression of joy and amazement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
on the child's face. Rudi obeyed. Outside he sat
down on the ground, and while the herdsman went
over to Clear Brook he took a big bite into his
bread, and then another and another, and could not
understand how there could be anything in the
world so delicious, and how he could have it, and
how there could still be some of it left,&mdash;for it was
a huge piece. The evening breeze played softly
about his head and swayed the young fir trees to
and fro, where the little bird was still sitting on its
topmost branch and singing forth into the golden
evening sky. Rudi's heart swelled with unknown
happiness and he felt like singing with the little bird.</p>

<p>Franz Martin had meanwhile gone back and
forth several times with his little pail. Each time
he had stood awhile by the stream and looked
about him. The mountains no longer glowed with
the evening light, but now the moon rose full and
golden from behind the white peaks. The herdsman
came back to the hut and stood beside Rudi,
who was still sitting quietly in the same spot.</p>

<p>"You like it here, do you?" he asked with a
smile. "You have finished your supper, I see.
What do you say to going home? See how the
moon has come to light your way."</p>

<p>Rudi had really had no thought of leaving, but
now he realized that it would probably be necessary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
He arose, thanked Franz Martin once more, and
started off. But he got no farther than the little
fir trees; something held him back. He looked
around once more, and finding that the herdsman
had gone into the cottage and could not see him,
he slipped in quickly under the shadowy bushes.
Franz Martin was the only person in all the world
who had ever been kind or sympathetic toward him.
This had so touched the boy that he could not go
away; he felt he must stay near this good man.
Hidden by the branches, Rudi peeped through an
opening to see if he might not get another glimpse
of his friend.</p>

<p>After a little while Franz Martin did come out
again. He stood before the door of his hut and
with folded arms looked out over the silent mountain
world as it lay before him in the soft moonlight.
The face of the herdsman, too, was illumined
by the gentle light. Any one seeing the face at
that moment, with its expression of peaceful happiness,
would have been the better for it. The man
folded his hands; he seemed to be saying a silent
evening prayer. Suddenly he said in a loud voice,
"God give you good night," and went into his hut
and closed the door. The good-night message must
have been for his old friends the mountains, and
the people whom he held in his heart, though he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
could not see them. Rudi had been looking on with
silent awe. If Franz Martin attracted every one
who ever knew him by his serene, pleasant ways,
what love and admiration must he have aroused in
the heart of little Rudi, whose only friend and
benefactor he was!</p>

<p>When all was dark and quiet in the hut, Rudi
rose and ran down the mountain as fast as he
could.</p>

<p>It was late, and there was no light to be seen in
the cottage; but he did not mind, for he knew the
door was never locked. He went quietly into the
house and crept into his bed, which he shared with
Uli. The latter was now sleeping heavily, after
having expressed his satisfaction at Rudi's absence
by exclaiming, "How lucky that Rudi is getting
too stupid even to find his bed! I have room to
sleep in comfort for once."</p>

<p>Rudi lay down quietly, and until his eyes closed
he still saw Franz Martin before him, standing in
the moonlight with folded hands. For the first
time in his life Rudi fell asleep with a happy heart.</p>

<small>A MINISTERING ANGEL</small></h3>




<p>The following day was Sunday. The community
of the Hillside belonged to the Beckenried church
in the valley. It was a long walk to church, but the
children were obliged to go to Sunday school regularly,
for the pastor was stern in insisting that the
children must be properly brought up. So on that
day the whole troop wended its way as usual down
the hill, and soon they were all sitting as quietly as
possible on the long wooden benches in church.
Other groups had assembled; the pastor got them
all settled, and then began. He said that he had
told them the last time about the life hereafter,
and as his glance fell on Rudi, he continued:
"Now, Rudi, I will ask you something that you
can surely answer, even if we cannot expect much
of you. Where will all good Christians&mdash;even the
poorest and lowliest of us, if we have led good lives&mdash;finally
be so happy as to know no more sorrow?"</p>

<p>"In the hut of the high pasture," Rudi replied
without hesitating.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>But he heard snickering all about him and looked
around timidly. Mocking faces met him on every
side and the children all seemed bursting with
suppressed laughter. Rudi bent down his head as
though he wished to crawl into the floor. Of the
pastor's previous lesson he had heard nothing, because
he had been engaged the whole hour in dodging
sly attacks from the rear. Now he had answered
the question entirely from his own experience.</p>

<p>The pastor looked at him steadily; but when he
saw that Rudi had no thought of laughing, but was
sitting there in fear and mortification, he shook his
head doubtfully and said, "There is nothing to be
done with him."</p>

<p>When the lesson was over the whole crowd came
running after Rudi, laughing noisily and shouting,
"Rudi, were you dreaming of the cheese party in
Sunday school?" and "Rudi, why didn't you tell
about cheese rolls?"</p>

<p>The boy ran away like a hunted rabbit, trying to
escape from his noisy tormentors. He ran up the
hill, where he knew the others would not pursue
him, for they meant to pass the pleasant summer
afternoon down in the village.</p>

<p>He ran farther and farther up the mountain.
For all his trials he had now a solace: he could fly
to the upper pasture and console himself with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
sight of Franz Martin's friendly face. There he
could sit very quietly in his little retreat and be
safe from pursuit. As he sat there to-day under
the fir trees, the little bird was again singing overhead.
The snow peaks glistened in the sun, and
here and there a clear mountain stream made its
way between green slopes of verdure.</p>

<p>Rudi breathed a sigh of contentment as he
looked over the peaceful scene. He forgot all
about his recent tormentors and was conscious
only of the one wish,&mdash;that he might never have
to leave this spot again. Now and then he got a
glimpse of Franz Martin, for whom he was continually
watching. Then he would crouch down and
make himself as small as possible, for he had the
feeling that if Franz Martin should find him here
again he might think he had come to get another
piece of bread and butter, while really it was only
because this man was the first and only person who
had ever been friendly and kind to him, so that he
felt happier in his presence than anywhere else in
the world. The herdsman did not discover him,
and Rudi sat in his little nook until the stars came
out and Franz Martin stepped forth from his hut
again and said, "God give you good night."</p>

<p>Then at last Rudi ran home. It was late, as on
the evening before, when he found his bed; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
to-night he was hungry, for he had had nothing
since morning. He did not mind it very much,
though, he had been so happy on the mountain.</p>

<p>So a whole week passed. Whenever Rudi thought
no one was watching him he ran up the alp and
slipped into his hiding place. There he would observe
the doings of the herdsman from moment to
moment, and never would he leave his hiding place
until Franz Martin had said, "God give you good
night." It seemed to him now as though the evening
blessing were meant for him, too.</p>

<p>The days that followed were exceptionally warm.
The sun rose each morning in a sky as cloudless as
that in which it had sunk the night before. The
pasturage was especially fine, and Franz Martin got
such rich milk from the cows that he turned out
most excellent cheeses. That pleased him, and his
happy whistle could be heard from earliest dawn
to evening as he went about his work. On Saturday
of this week he was at work even earlier than
usual, for this was one of the days when he was
to carry three or four of the cheeses down to
the lake and have them shipped. Soon he had
them packed and strapped to his back and was
trudging in happy mood down the mountain,
alpenstock in hand. It was the hottest day of
the whole summer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>The farther down he went the more he was oppressed
by the excessive heat, and many times he
said to himself, "Oh, how glad I shall be to get
back to my hut this evening in the cool upper air!
Down here it is like an oven."</p>

<p>He reached the landing place just as the boat
came in that was to carry the cheese. His business
was quickly settled, and then he stood a moment
thinking whether he should go right back up the
mountain or stop for something to eat. But he had
no appetite; his head was hot and heavy and he
wished only to get back. Then some one touched
his arm. It was one of the ship hands who had
just helped load the boat.</p>

<p>"Come, Franz Martin; it is a warm day; we'll
go in the shade and have a glass of wine," he said,
as he drew the herdsman toward the tavern where
the big trees stood.</p>

<p>Franz Martin was hot and thirsty and was not
averse to sitting down a little while in the shade.
He emptied his glass at one draught; but in a few
moments he rose, saying that he felt quite oppressed
by this heavy lower air, and that he was used to
cold milk and water and not to wine. He took
leave of his companion and started off with long
strides up the mountain. But never had he found
the ascent so difficult. The noonday sun beat upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
his head, his pulse throbbed, and his feet were so
heavy that he could scarcely lift them. But he kept
on resolutely. The steeper the alp the longer grew
his strides, and he spurred himself on with the prospect
that now there was only an hour, now a half
hour, and at last only a quarter hour of hot climbing
before him; then he would be at home and
could lie down to rest on the fresh hay.</p>

<p>Now he had reached the last steep ascent. The
sun burned like fire on his head; suddenly all grew
dark before his eyes; he swayed and fell heavily to
the ground&mdash;he had lost consciousness.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When the milker came in the evening he found
that Franz Martin had not yet returned. He set
the milk down in the corner and went away; he
never thought of looking about for the dairyman.
But there was some one else there who had been
looking for Franz Martin for a long time, and that
was Rudi. The boy had been sitting in his retreat
for several hours. He knew every step the herdsman
had to make and how his duties followed one
after another; he was very much surprised to see
how long Franz Martin left the milk standing to-day,
for he had always poured it immediately into the
various vessels. Some of it, for buttering, was
poured into the big round pans and left to stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
until all the cream rose to the top in a thick layer;
the rest of it was poured into the cheese kettle. All
this Rudi had seen from day to day through the
open house door.</p>

<p>Still the herdsman did not come. The boy began
to feel that there was something wrong. He came
out very softly from his hiding place and went
toward the hut. Here all was still and deserted, in
the lower room as well as in the hayloft above.
There was no fire crackling under the kettle; not
a sound was to be heard; everything seemed dead.
Rudi ran anxiously around the outside of the hut,
up and down, and in all directions. Then, suddenly,
down on the path he spied Franz Martin lying on
the ground. He ran toward the spot. There lay
his friend with closed eyes, groaning and languishing
in great distress. He was fiery hot and his lips
were dry and hard. Rudi stood and stared for a
moment, pale with fright, at his benefactor. Then
he ran down the mountain as fast as he could run.</p>

<p>Franz Martin had been lying on the ground unconscious
for many hours; a terrible fever had
come upon him. He was tortured by awful thirst.
Now and then it seemed to him in his fever that
he was coming to water and was about to bend
over and drink. In his efforts to get at the water
he would wake up for a moment, for it had only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
been delirium. Then he found himself still lying
on the ground, unable to move, and longing in vain
for a drop of water. He would lose consciousness
again and dream he was lying down in the swamp
where he had seen the fine strawberries as he
passed this morning. There he saw them hanging
still. Oh, how he longed for them! He put out
his hand, but in vain,&mdash;he could not reach them.
But presently he had one in his mouth; an angel
was kneeling beside him and had given it to him,&mdash;one,
and another, and another. Oh, how good
the juice tasted in his parched mouth! Franz Martin
licked and smacked his lips over the refreshing
morsel. He awoke. Was it really true? was he
really awake? It was no dream; there knelt the
angel beside him and laid another big, juicy strawberry
in his mouth.</p>

<p>"Oh, you good angel, another one!" said Franz
Martin softly; but not one only,&mdash;five, six, the
angel put into his mouth, and Franz Martin eagerly
devoured them. Suddenly a look of pain shot over
his face; he laid his hand on his forehead and could
only murmur, "Water," before he became quite unconscious
again; he could not even eat the last
strawberry.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 50%" >
<img src="images/083.jpg" alt="He greedily drank the cool water" style="width: 80%" />
</div>



<p>He dreamed most horrible things: his head
grew as big as his very largest ball of butter, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>then grew still larger and so very heavy that he
thought in terror, "I shall not be able to carry it
alone; they will have to hold it up with props,&mdash;like
an overloaded apple tree." And then he felt quite
plainly that his head was full of gunpowder; some
one had lighted it from behind and now it was burning
with awful fury and soon would blow everything
to pieces. Then suddenly Clear Brook came running
down over his brow, cool and invigorating,
then over his whole face and into his mouth; and
Franz Martin swallowed and swallowed, and awoke
to consciousness.</p>

<p>It was quite true,&mdash;shower after shower of icy
water ran over his face; then he felt something at
his mouth like a little bowl, and he greedily drank
the cool water. Over him were the twinkling stars.
These he could see plainly, and also that he was still
lying out on the open ground. But it could not be
Clear Brook that was flowing over him and giving
him drink. He could not make out what it was, but
it felt very good and refreshing, and he murmured
gratefully, "O blessed Father, how I thank you for
your kindness and for this ministering angel!"</p>

<p>At last he felt something on his brow, so cool
and comforting that he said, "Now the fire cannot
get through," and contentedly fell asleep and
dreamed no more.</p>

<small>AS THE MOTHER WISHES IT</small></h3>




<p>The sun was rising in splendor from behind the
high peaks when Franz Martin opened his eyes and
looked about him confusedly. He shivered a little,&mdash;he
felt chilly. He wanted to sit up, but his head
was heavy and dull. He put his hand to his brow;
it seemed as though there was something lying
on it. And he was not mistaken; sixfold, wet and
heavy, his big kerchief that he had left in the hut
lay upon his head. He pushed it away, and as the
cool morning breeze played across his brow he
felt so refreshed and strengthened that he sat up
quickly and looked about him. He met a pair of
big, serious eyes fixed steadfastly upon him.</p>

<p>"Are you here, Rudi?" he asked in surprise.
"How did you get up so early? But now that you
are here, come closer, so that I can lean on your
shoulder; I am dizzy and cannot get up alone."</p>

<p>Rudi sprang up from his seat and went close to
the herdsman. He braced his feet on the ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
with all his might so that Franz Martin would have
a firm support in him. In the toilsome ascent to
the hut the herdsman, still leaning on the boy's
shoulder, began to recall one thing after another
that had occurred to him; but there were various
incidents for which he could not account. Perhaps
Rudi could help him out.</p>

<p>On reaching the hut Franz Martin sat down on
one of the three-legged stools and said: "Rudi,
bring the other stool and sit down by me. But first
get down the big jar and we will have a good drink
of cold milk together, for I cannot make a fire yet.
There is a little bowl beside it; see&mdash;" He stopped
and looked about in surprise. "But what has become
of it? I always set it up there; I don't know
what has happened to me since yesterday."</p>

<p>Rudi's face turned fiery red; he knew well enough
who had taken down the little bowl. He said timidly,
"It is down there on the ground," and ran and
fetched it; then he brought the milk jar, and set
them both down before Franz Martin.</p>

<p>The latter shook his head in perplexity. As
long as he had lived he had never set his bowl on
the ground there by the door. He drank his milk
silently and thoughtfully, filled the bowl afresh,
and said: "Come, Rudi, you drink, too. You have
done me a good service in coming up so early. Did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
you think there might be cheese rolls to-day, and
you would be here first?"</p>

<p>"No; truly I did not," protested Rudi.</p>

<p>"Well, tell me this," continued the herdsman,
who had been looking now at the wet cloth that
lay on the table, now at the little water pail that
stood waiting at the door as if ready to start out,&mdash;"tell
me, Rudi, did I have the cloth on my head
when you came up early this morning?"</p>

<p>Rudi turned scarlet, for he thought that if Franz
Martin heard all that he had done perhaps he would
not be pleased; but the man was looking him so
earnestly in the eyes that he had to tell all. "I
laid it on your head," he began bashfully.</p>

<p>"But why, Rudi?" asked the herdsman in surprise.</p>

<p>"Because you were so hot," answered Rudi.</p>

<p>Franz Martin was more and more astonished.
"But I was awake at sunrise. When did you come
up?"</p>

<p>"Yesterday at five, or perhaps four, o'clock,"
stammered Rudi timidly. "The milker did not
come until long afterward."</p>

<p>"What! you were up here all night? What did
you do or want here?"</p>

<p>But the herdsman saw that Rudi was quite terrified.
The visions of the night recurred to him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
with fatherly kindness he patted the boy's shoulder
and said encouragingly, "With me you need not
be afraid, Rudi. Here, drink another glass of milk
and then tell me everything that happened from
the time that you got here."</p>

<p>Cheered thus, Rudi took new courage. He drank
the milk in long draughts; it tasted delicious to
the hungry, thirsty boy. Then he began to relate:
"I came up here to sit in the bushes a little while,
but only as I did every day, not on account of the
cheese rolls. And then, after the milker had brought
the milk and you did not come for so long, I looked
for you, and I found you on the ground, and you
were red and hot and seemed thirsty. So I ran
down quickly to the swamp and got all the big
strawberries I could find and brought them up to
you, and you were glad for them. But you pointed
to your head and wanted water on it. I fetched
the little bowl out of the hut, and the pail, and
filled them at the brook, and poured the water over
your head and gave you to drink, for you were very
thirsty. Whenever the pail was empty I went to
the brook and filled it; but because the water ran
off your head so fast I thought a heavy cloth would
keep wet a long time. So I got the cloth out of
the hut and laid it thick and wet on your head and
dipped it in the pail whenever it got dry and hot;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
and then at last you awoke when it was morning,
and I was very glad. I was afraid you might get
very sick."</p>

<p>Franz Martin had been listening with earnest
attention. Now everything that he had gone
through in the night was plain to him,&mdash;how he
thought an angel had come to him with strawberries,
and how he afterward enjoyed the water of
Clear Brook as the real water of life. Franz Martin
sat and gazed at Rudi in dumb amazement, as
though he had never seen a boy before. Such a
boy as this he had certainly never seen. How was
it possible, he said to himself, that this boy, whom
every one, young and old, never called anything
else but "Stupid Rudi," had been clever enough to
save his life, which had certainly been in great
danger?&mdash;for what a fever had been consuming
him the herdsman knew perfectly well. Had Rudi
not quieted this fever with his cooling showers,
who knows what might have developed by morning?
And how could this boy, whom no one
thought worthy of a friendly word, be capable of
such self-sacrifice that he would sit up and care
for him all night?</p>

<p>Tears came to the eyes of the big, stalwart man
as he looked at the timid, despised little fellow, and
thought this all over. Then he took the boy by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
hand and said: "We will be good friends, Rudi; I
have much to thank you for and I shall not forget
it. Do me one more favor. I am so weak and
shaky that I must lie down and rest. You go
down to my mother and tell her to come to me.
Say that I am not quite well. But you must come
back with her, for I have much to talk over with
you to-day. Don't forget."</p>

<p>In his whole life Rudi had never been so happy.
He ran down the mountain, leaping and skipping
for joy. Franz Martin had himself told him to
come again, and now he need no longer hide, but
might walk right into the hut, and, better still,
Franz Martin had said that he would be good
friends with him. At each new thought Rudi
leaped high into the air, and before he knew it he
had reached the Hillside. Just as he was coming
down from above in jumps toward the neat little
cottage with the shining windows, Frau Vincenze
came up from below in her Sunday clothes, prayer
book in hand. The boy ran toward her, but for
several moments could say nothing; he was quite
out of breath with running.</p>

<p>"Where do you come from?" said the proper
little woman disapprovingly, as she looked the boy
over from head to foot. She thought that Sunday
should be fittingly observed, and Rudi presented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
anything but a holiday appearance in his little, old,
ragged trousers and shirt. "I think I have seen
you across the stream," she said; "you must belong
to Poor Grass Joe?"</p>

<p>"No, I am only Rudi," the boy replied very
humbly.</p>

<p>Then it occurred to the woman that Joe's wife
had a foolish boy in her house, who would never
be of any use, people said. This was probably the
boy. "But what do you want of me?" she asked
in growing astonishment.</p>

<p>Rudi had found his breath again and now delivered
his message clearly and correctly. The mother
was very much alarmed. Never before had her
sturdy Franz Martin had any illness, and that he
should now send for her, instead of coming down
himself, was to her a very bad indication. Without
saying a word she went into the house, carefully
packed everything that she thought they
might need, and in a few moments came out with
a big basket on her arm.</p>

<p>"Come," she said to Rudi; "we will start right
up. Why must you go back?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," he answered shyly, and then
added hesitatingly, as though he were afraid it
might be something wrong, "Must I not carry the
basket?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, yes! I understand," the mother said to
herself; "Franz Martin thought that I should be
bringing all sorts of remedies, and the boy was to
carry them for me."</p>

<p>She gave Rudi the basket. Silently she walked
beside him up the mountain, for her thoughts
were troubled. Her son was her pride and joy;
and was he really ill,&mdash;perhaps dangerously so?
Her alarm increased as she approached the hut.
Her knees trembled so that she could hardly
keep up.</p>

<p>She entered the hut. There was no one there.
She looked all about, then up into the hayloft.
There lay her son buried in the hay; she could
hardly see him. With beating heart she climbed
the ladder. Rudi remained respectfully standing
outside the door after he had shoved the basket
inside. As the mother bent anxiously over her son
he opened his blue eyes, cheerily stretched forth his
hand, and sitting up, said: "God bless you, mother!
I am glad you have come. I have been sleeping like
a bear ever since Rudi went away."</p>

<p>The mother stared at her son, half pleased, half
terrified. She did not know what to think.</p>

<p>"Franz Martin," she said earnestly, "what is
wrong with you? Are you talking in delirium, or
do you know that you sent for me?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, yes, mother," laughed Franz Martin; "my
mind is clear now and the fever is past. But my
limbs were all atremble; I could not come down
to you, and I wanted so much to talk to you. My
knees are shaky even now, and I could not get
very far."</p>

<p>"But what is it? What was it? Tell me about
it," urged the mother, sitting down on the hay
beside her son.</p>

<p>"I will explain it all to you, mother, just as it
happened," he said quietly, as he leaned back against
the hay; "but first look at that poor, gaunt, little
boy down there, who hasn't a decent garment to
his name, whom no one thinks worthy of a kind
word, and who is known only as 'Stupid Rudi.'"</p>

<p>The mother looked down at Rudi, who was
watching the herdsman with much concern to see
whether he was going to faint again.</p>

<p>"Well, and then?" asked the mother intently.</p>

<p>"He saved my life, mother. If it had not been
for this little boy, I should still be lying out on the
ground in deadly fever, or it might even be all ended
with me by this time."</p>

<p>Then Franz Martin told her everything that had
happened since the afternoon before,&mdash;how Rudi
had stayed with him all night and had cared for
him and relieved him from the consuming thirst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
and fever, and had cooled the fire in his head.
The cleverest person in the world could not have
done it better, and perhaps no other person would
have done it for him.</p>

<p>Again and again the mother had to wipe away
her tears. She thought to herself, what if her
Franz Martin had lain out there all alone and forsaken
in his agony of thirst, and had been quite
consumed by the fever, and no one had known
anything about him!</p>

<p>Then such joy and gratitude rose in her heart
that she cried aloud: "God be thanked! God be
thanked!"</p>

<p>And for little Rudi she suddenly felt such a
heart full of love that she exclaimed eagerly:
"Franz Martin, Rudi shall not go back to Joe's
wife! The boy has probably been only half fed,
and she has let him run about in dirt and rags.
This very day he shall go with me, and to-morrow
I will make him some decent clothes. He shall
not fare poorly with us; we will not forget what
he has done for you."</p>

<p>"That is exactly what I wanted, mother, but of
course I had to find out what you would say to it;
now you have the same plan as I, and have thought
it all out in the best possible way. There is nothing
in the world like a mother, after all!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>And Franz Martin looked at her so lovingly and
happily that it warmed her to her heart's core, and
she thought to herself, "Nor is there anything in
the world like a manly, virtuous son." Then she
said: "Now you must eat and get strong again.
I have brought fresh eggs and wheat bread, and I
will go and start the fire. Take your time about
coming down"; which Franz Martin found that
he was really obliged to do, for he was still weak
and trembling. But he finally succeeded. When
he got down he beckoned to Rudi, who had been
looking in through the door all this time, to come
and sit at the table beside him.</p>

<p>"Rudi," he said, smiling into the boy's eyes,
"do you want to grow up to be a dairyman?"</p>

<p>A look of joy came over Rudi's face, but the next
moment it disappeared, for in his ears rang the discouraging
words that he had heard so many, many
times,&mdash;"He will never amount to anything," "He
can't do anything," "He will never be of any use,"&mdash;and
he answered despondently, "I can never be
anything."</p>

<p>"Rudi, you shall be a dairyman," said Franz
Martin decisively. "You have done very well in
your first undertaking. Now you shall stay with
me and carry milk and water and help me in everything,
and I will show you how to make butter and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
cheese, and as soon as you are old enough you
shall stand beside me at the kettle and be my
helpmate."</p>

<p>"Here, in your hut?" asked Rudi, to whom the
prospect of such happiness was almost incomprehensible.</p>

<p>"Right here in my hut," declared Franz Martin.</p>

<p>In Rudi's face appeared an expression of such
radiant joy that the herdsman could not take his
eyes from him. The boy seemed transformed.
The mother, too, noticed it, as she set on the table
before them the big plate of egg omelet that she
had just prepared. She patted the boy's head and
said, "Yes, little Rudi, to-day we will be happy
together, and to-morrow, too; and every day we
will thank the good God that he brought you to
Franz Martin at just the right time, although no
one may know why it was that you came up here."</p>

<p>The happy feast began. Never in his life had
Rudi seen so many good things together on a
table; for besides the omelet the mother had set
out fresh wheat bread and a big, golden ball of
butter and a piece of snow-white cheese, while in
the middle of the table stood a bowl of creamy
milk. Of each dish there was a generous portion
for Rudi, and when he had finished one helping
there was another ready for him.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>
<p>When the mother was preparing to go home
in the evening she said: "Franz Martin, I have
changed my mind. Rudi shall stay up here with
you until you are strong. He can fetch things
and be useful to you. I will arrange matters with
Joe's wife."</p>

<p>Franz Martin was satisfied, and Rudi's happiness
knew no bounds. Now he was really at home with
Franz Martin. That night, when the evening blessing
was said, he was not crouching under the fir
trees, but stood beside his friend under the starry
sky, as the latter folded his hands and said, "Come,
Rudi, we will say our evening prayer."</p>

<p>Reverently he, too, folded his hands, and when
at the close the herdsman said, "God give you
good night," Rudi's heart was so full of joy that
he wanted to call out the blessing to everybody in
the world,&mdash;"God give you good night!"</p>

<p>That very evening the mother went over to Joe's
wife. The latter was standing before her house with
the three boys and Lisi, and was trying to make
out what they were telling her. They were all
talking at once, and all she could understand was
that it was something about Franz Martin, whose
illness the milker had told them about. When
Frau Vincenze explained why she had come, and
said that she and her son had agreed to take Rudi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
as their own child, the woman made a great ado,
assuring her that they would do far better to take
one of her three boys, who would be much more
help to Franz Martin, a hundred times more, than
Stupid Rudi.</p>

<p>And the boys all shouted at the top of their
voices, "Me! me! me!" for they well knew how
kind Franz Martin was, and what good things there
were to eat in the hut on the mountain. But all
their begging and clamoring was in vain. Frau
Vincenze said very quietly that she was determined
to have Rudi, that she knew him, and that he had
more heart and sense than many another who called
him "Stupid Rudi." Moreover, she wanted to warn
the boys to be careful henceforth about their jeering
and gibing, or they would have to settle with
Franz Martin and his strong arm. When she left
them they all stared after her, dumb and stupefied,
and each one of the children thought in his heart,
"I wish I were Rudi! he'll have fine times,&mdash;like
a king, up in Franz Martin's hut."</p>

<p>From that day on, whenever the boys saw Rudi
anywhere, they ran after him and each one wanted
to be his best friend, for they all remembered the
last cheese party when Rudi was so badly treated.
But now he would surely have all the cheese rolls
to himself, and so it would be a good thing to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
his friend. And later they did find it a good thing,
for Rudi took great delight in dividing the rich
harvest of cheese rolls among them all. He never
ceased wondering at the way all the children had
changed toward him, and at their not jeering or
laughing at him any more.</p>

<p>When he got over being afraid of people, it
turned out, to the surprise of all, that he was a
very apt, nimble little fellow, of whom every one
said, "Either he is not the same boy, or else we
were all wrong in calling him 'Stupid Rudi.'"</p>

<h3 class="no-break">CHAPTER I<br />
<small>UNDER THE ALDERS</small></h3>





<p>The Alders is the name of an estate famed for
its rich fields and smiling meadows and for its
wealth of luscious fruits. Apple and pear trees
stand in plenty on its well-kept fields, and if the
year be a good one they stand at harvest time with
drooping branches, and their red and yellow treasure
gleams from afar like gold.</p>

<p>At some distance from the house and barn lies
the great pasture land, where in the sunny autumn
days eight sleek cows graze contentedly upon the
fragrant grass, making sweet music as they wander
to and fro,&mdash;for each cow wears a little bell about
her neck. Sometimes the whole herd starts up
together into lively movement; then the pleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
sound is carried far down into the valley and gladdens
the heart of the traveler upon the highway
below.</p>

<p>Through the middle of the pasture runs a low
stone wall that marks the boundary line of this
farm; for the land beyond belongs to the estate
of Lindenhof. Halfway down the wall, and close
beside it, stand two great alder trees whose swaying
branches cast pleasant shadows on the wall and
give the estate its name of The Alders.</p>

<p>On the neighboring farm a mighty linden tree
has stood since ancient times. It guards the dooryard
and spreads its branches far out over the
farmhouse and the big stone well. From it the
estate takes its name of Lindenhof.</p>

<p>These two farms, though not especially large,
are among the finest of all those that lie scattered
over the mountain side in the parish of Buschweil.</p>

<p>One morning in September, as the sun lay warm
and soft on the wall, a little girl of about ten years
came running across the meadow. In her right
hand she carried a long switch; with her left she
was holding together the folds of her apron, carefully
guarding something within that seemed to be
of great value, for she would stop every now and
then to open the folds, peep inside, and then draw
them together again with a happy smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>When she reached the wall she stopped and
looked over into the neighboring pasture. Her blue
eyes shone forth merrily from her little blond head,
wreathed about with its two long braids, and fresh
and pink was the little face that turned expectantly
from side to side. Disappointed at not finding any
one there, the little girl dropped the switch from
her hand, and, reaching into her apron, brought
forth a bright red apple, which she set upon the
wall. Then she brought out another and another,
and still others, until there was a long row of them.</p>

<p>"Ho! hey! Gretchen!" came a lusty cry from
below; then, amid noise of shouting, tinkling bells,
and fierce snapping of a whip, a boy came rushing
up the slope. The cows followed with noisy accompaniment,
for the vigorous whipsnapping had
brought them along in quite a tumult.</p>

<p>"Why are you so late?" Gretchen called out to
the boy.</p>

<p>"Because I&mdash;I had&mdash;there were so many
things&mdash;well, I really don't know why it was."</p>

<p>With these words Renti had reached the wall and
now stood breathless before Gretchen, who had seated
herself on the top and was looking down at him.</p>

<p>"Now you see how it is," she said; "and the next
time I am late you must be patient. You find that
you can't always get here when you wish."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, you are right. I didn't consider before.
And then it's always so stupid here until you come.
Oh, how hot, how hot!" he cried, throwing down
his whip and brushing back his thick brown hair
with both hands. Then he stretched out full length
on the ground and gazed up into the blue sky.</p>

<p>Gretchen smiled down from her cool seat under
the alders.</p>

<p>"It isn't hot at all, but you have run so fast.
Where are the potatoes?"</p>

<p>Renti pointed to a sack that he had thrown
down beside the wall.</p>

<p>"What fine apples!" he said, raising his head a
little and looking up approvingly at the big red
treasures set out in a row. Then he lay down
again, turned his eyes to the sky, and in the fullness
of his joy began to whistle.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the herds were grazing peacefully on
both sides of the children. The gentle tinkling of
bells was heard here and there, as the cows wandered
to all parts of the meadow. In the alder
trees the birds were singing gayly; a fresh mountain
breeze swayed the branches and now and then
blew away some of the leaves that Gretchen had
gathered and spread out in her lap. She was weaving
them into a wreath by fastening the stem of
each leaf into the back of the preceding one. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
made a dainty little garland, for the leaves that
Gretchen used were of a certain delicate kind. She
would take the wreaths home afterward and lay
them in the hymn book, where they would serve
as bookmarks for the verses she was to learn for
Sunday school.</p>

<p>Occasionally the little girl would look up from
her work to see whether her eight cows were all
in sight and grazing properly, neither disturbing
each other nor being disturbed by outside causes.
Gretchen knew all her cows by name and had come
to know the character and peculiarities of each one
in her two years of intimate association with them,&mdash;for
this was not her first season at herding. She
had been to pasture with them in the previous
summer and fall and had herded them alone,&mdash;that
is, with the help of Renti, who was always on
the other side. At least, his cows were there; he
himself was wherever Gretchen was,&mdash;on the wall,
on her side or on his.</p>

<p>Renti was now lying unconcernedly in the sunny
grass, not paying much attention to his cows, for
he had great confidence in his strength and quickness,
should anything happen among them.</p>

<p>Gretchen had looked several times toward one
particular spot, where two of the cows were standing
in a rather strange, unnatural manner; they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
were not eating, and were holding their heads up
in the air.</p>

<p>"Renti," she said, "I believe there is something
wrong. Look how strangely Star and Brownie hold
their heads, and they are not eating. Now Brindle
is beginning to act frightened, too. Look, Renti!"</p>

<p>Renti sprang to his feet. At the same moment
a big, terrible head appeared over the brow of the
hill in Gretchen's field. Then the rest of the
animal came into sight,&mdash;a wild, snorting steer
that came rushing furiously up the hill. The cows
ran about in terror. The bells jangled loud and
wild, like storm bells. Renti's cows now began
to rush about, too.</p>

<p>Gretchen jumped down off the wall to Renti's side.
"O Renti! look, look! he is coming! Where shall
we go?" she cried, pale with fright.</p>

<p>Renti made one leap over the wall. Then, setting
up a terrible howl and roar, as though he were himself
a wild beast, he charged down upon the steer,
at the same time cracking his whip as hard as he
could. The beast came on with increasing fury;
Renti increased his noise.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="I109"></a></p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 50%" >
<img src="images/109.jpg" alt="He charged down upon the steer" style="width: 80%" />
</div>



<p>Then the creature stopped, stood motionless.
Renti howled, snapped his whip, and ran toward
him. Suddenly the steer turned tail and galloped
away. Renti dashed after him, still screaming and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>raging like a madman. The beast, in growing terror,
ran toward the steep descent that led to the
fields of Broadwood Farm, from which he had
escaped. There Renti finally stopped and turned
back. He was breathless from the chase, but he
came back on a run to Gretchen's side. As she
stood there waiting for him, her face was pale, but
her blue eyes shone bright with joy.</p>

<p>"Oh, but I'm glad you're back, Renti!" she said
with a deep breath. "I was so frightened when you
went after him, for fear he would catch you up on
his horns and gore you."</p>

<p>"You must never be afraid," Renti assured her,
breathless and almost voiceless, for he had well-nigh
split his lungs with his screaming. Suddenly he
laughed aloud as he thought of the extraordinary
leaps the creature had made in terror of his noise.</p>

<p>"What if I had been alone!" said the girl, trembling
anew at the thought. "If you had not been
with me, where could I have taken refuge? He
would surely have caught me on his horns and
thrown me down and trampled on me! Oh, oh!
And he would have gored the cows to death, too."
And Gretchen trembled anew at the thought of
what might have happened.</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid, Gretchen; I will always be with
you," Renti said reassuringly; "and in the morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
I will always be here when you come. Depend
upon it, I shan't be late half a minute; I will manage
somehow. But I mean to tell them at home
what happened to-day, and they will send word to
the farmer of Broadwood to tie up his steer so
that he can't get out again; so don't be scared
any more."</p>

<p>The children went back to their place on the wall
and Gretchen was at length quieted by the boy's
assurances. The cows were grazing again with
gentle, tinkling accompaniment, and everything
round about them seemed so quiet and peaceful
that before long the children had forgotten all
about the disturbance.</p>

<p>Now the sound of church bells came floating on
the wind from the villages round about. It was
eleven o'clock, the hour when the noon bell rings
in this region, the signal for the wives at work in
the fields to shoulder their tools and go home to
cook dinner. In the meadows the herd boys and
girls began to bestir themselves, and here and
there a thin wreath of smoke arose. As it curled
up into the blue sky gay shouts and yodeling went
up with it.</p>

<p>Renti leaped down from the wall. "Come, it is
time for lunch!" he cried, running to the place where
he had laid down his sack and bringing it forth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>Gretchen, with dainty care, arranged her garlands
on the top of the wall, placing pebbles on them so
that the wind might not blow them away; then she
jumped down. Renti had emptied the contents of
his sack on the ground. There lay potatoes, bits
of wood, a piece of cheese, and several bricks, all
tossed in together.</p>

<p>"You ought to wrap your cheese in paper,"
Gretchen told him, as she stooped to pick it up
from the ground. "Look, it is all red from the
bricks and covered with bits of wood."</p>

<p>Taking out her pocketknife, she scraped away
the dirt, while Renti looked on with great relief,
for the red and black speckled mass had struck
him with pained surprise. Then Gretchen drew a
little package from her pocket; that was her piece
of cheese, wrapped in a clean, stout paper. She
opened the parcel and, placing Renti's piece with
her own, laid them together on the wall.</p>

<p>"What are the bricks for?" asked Gretchen.</p>

<p>"To make a better fire. See; we'll build a
hearth with them." And Renti arranged his five
bricks to form a sort of fireplace on the ground.
Then he carefully heaped up chips inside and lighted
them. The flame leaped up in an instant and filled
the fireplace and Renti had to hunt about for more
chips to keep the fire going. When the big flames<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
had subsided and only single little tongues came out
here and there from the ashes, Gretchen approached
and carefully laid the potatoes in the embers, each
one in a good glowing spot; and wherever the
ashes seemed to be turning gray, Renti blew upon
them with all his might until they glowed again.
He kept putting on dry grass and chips, so that the
flames continued to burn between the potatoes.</p>

<p>Gretchen watched the crackling embers very
earnestly. Renti had to run off to one side every
now and then to cool his face, for with the blowing
and poking it had become almost as hot as the fire.
After some time Gretchen said, "There, now they
are ready. Have you the shingle, Renti?"</p>

<p>"Yes, here it is," he answered, as he drew forth
a little board and also a long willow wand from
under the sack. The supple willow twig had been
bent down from the top and fastened upon itself
with a thread, so that it made a loop. With this
the children drew out one potato after another from
the fire, sliding them onto the shingle and then to
the top of the wall.</p>

<p>When all the potatoes had been laid out in a row
on the wall, Gretchen looked about for a comfortable
seat, where the shadow of the alders was thickest,
for now the sun was in the zenith and poured down
with considerable warmth from the cloudless sky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come, Renti; up here it is fine," she said, as she
settled herself and laid out beside her some large
leaves that she had gathered. Renti was by her
side in a moment, and then they sat and watched
the little clouds of gray steam rise from the potatoes
and float off on the wind. But now they had
waited long enough; Gretchen took up one potato
after another and rubbed off the charred outer layer
with one of the big leaves that she had at hand.
She was careful, however, to save the crisp brown
skin, for that was the part they liked best of all.
Then their noonday meal began. The children sat
up on their little elevation with a potato in one hand
and a piece of cheese in the other, taking delicious
bites now from one, now from the other. Overhead
the birds were singing in the alder branches; across
the meadow lay the golden sunshine; and in the
grass at their feet the blue harebells tossed merrily
in the breeze.</p>

<p>"Gretchen," said Renti, taking alternate bites
from his right, then from his left hand, "would
you rather be a king and sit on a throne and
wear a golden crown on your head, or would you
rather sit on the stone wall in the alder shade
and eat baked potatoes and listen to the birds'
singing?"</p>

<p>Gretchen hesitated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," she said, after some reflection, "a king
can have whatever he wishes; so, besides having
everything else, he could still sit on the wall and
eat baked potatoes whenever he pleased."</p>

<p>"No, he couldn't; that wouldn't be proper; a
king must always sit on his throne," declared Renti.
"But I know"&mdash;and in his ardor Renti raised his
fist high in the air and thumped it down on his knee&mdash;"I'd
a thousand, thousand times rather sit here
than be a king on a throne, for he could have
nothing better than we have here."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; it is true," Gretchen agreed. "I like
it best here, too."</p>

<p>"I'm sure you do. Oh, how good this potato
tastes! and do you hear that finch?"</p>

<p>Renti tried to imitate the bird's whistle. Then
he took another bite of potato, but being obliged to
express his happiness in some way, he beat time to
the bird's melody by kicking his feet against the
wall. "Surely this is the loveliest spot in all the
world. Where could it be finer? Or do you think
it may be more beautiful in heaven?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," replied Gretchen positively;
"where all the beautiful white angels are, with lilies
in their hands."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it is. Among so many strange
people we'd be afraid and shouldn't know how to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
behave; I'm sure it wouldn't be nearly so nice as
it is here, where we two are alone together and can
do just as we please, and are masters of the whole
meadow and of the cows and everything. No, I'm
sure it isn't so nice anywhere on earth or in heaven."</p>

<p>But Gretchen was not easily convinced.</p>

<p>"You have never been to heaven and can't be at
all sure about it," she declared. "But come, let's
have the apples now."</p>

<p>The first part of the meal, the more substantial
portion, was now over, and as it had been of a rather
dry nature it had made the children very thirsty; so
the juicy, sourish apples tasted most delicious, and
disappeared so fast that soon there were only two
left. A few more bites finished these, too, and then
Renti made himself comfortable on the wall and said,
"That was the best dinner that any person could
have." And Gretchen agreed with him perfectly.</p>

<p>The afternoon brought a number of unexpected
happenings. Star and Brindle got into a quarrel
because both wanted to graze in exactly the same
spot. They began to horn each other and the children
had to run down and separate them. Then they
kept them grazing in different parts of the pasture
for a while until the cows had got over their quarrelsome
mood. Later Renti saw that Molly, the
slender black one of his herd, was bounding across
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>the pasture toward the hedge beyond, and three or
four of the others, seeing her, started in pursuit.
The whole herd seemed about to follow their example.
Renti started after them with loud "Ho!" and
"Hey!" and turned them back just before they
reached the hedge, where they seemed to have no
intention of stopping, although the high jump would
certainly have had disastrous results for them. On
the other side of the hedge the grass had been cut
and was spread out in the sun to dry. It had wafted
such tempting odors to Molly's nostrils that she had
started off on a run to follow up the scent.</p>

<p>So one thing after another happened during the
afternoon to keep the children busy. The cows
were healthy and well fed, and toward evening,
when they were no longer hungry, they were subject
to all sorts of whims and notions that the children
had difficulty in restraining. When the herd
on one side was quiet something would happen in
the other field, and the children ran back and forth,
for they always helped each other. It was much
pleasanter to do together whatever had to be done.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the sun had moved far on toward evening
and was about to set. The mountains began
to redden and all the little hills around seemed
covered with gold. Suddenly a loud tooting sound
was heard, first on the right hand, then on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
left, then from varying distances. It was the signal,
blown forth on immense horns, to the herd
boys and girls that it was time to bring the herds
home for milking. And the cows seemed to know
the sound, for they gathered in a group from all
sides of the pasture and stood waiting.</p>

<p>"Good night, Renti!" "Good night, Gretchen!"
the children called to each other.</p>

<p>Renti, with three or four bounds, landed in the
middle of his herd, and cracking his whip and
yodeling at the top of his voice, he ran on toward
the Lindenhof stables.</p>

<p>Gretchen gathered up the two little garlands she
had made and spread them out on the palm of her
hand; then she, too, moved on toward home, accompanied
almost to her door by Renti's loud yodeling.</p>

<small>THE TWO FARMS</small></h3>




<p>The house at Lindenhof had a big, comfortable
living room, with a green Dutch-tiled stove in the
middle and wooden benches all along the walls.
Around the stove there was also a bench, where
an old gray cat usually lay purring lazily. Wide
steps, that were like many little benches set over
one another, led upstairs to the sleeping rooms. In
this way there was abundant opportunity for sitting
down in any part of the room, and this gave
the place an air of ease and comfort.</p>

<p>The farmer and his wife had two daughters, one
twenty, the other nineteen years old; but they were
no longer at home, both having married in the previous
summer, one soon after the other. They had
both married well, for the young farmers whom they
had taken to husband had farms of their own and
were comfortably established. Now the father and
mother were by themselves again, as in the beginning.
At first they kept only one hired man, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
the husband said, "We'd better hire day laborers
in the busy season, and then be alone the rest of
the time, than to keep several men in the house."</p>

<p>And the wife said: "I think so, too. I do not
like the tramp of heavy boots about the house."</p>

<p>So the household went on in its old quiet way,
and still the work was properly done.</p>

<p>But when autumn came the farmer said: "We
must have a herd boy. The hired man cannot sit
out in the meadow all day when there is so much
work still to be done, and yet we cannot leave the
cows out in the pasture all alone."</p>

<p>And the wife said: "That would suit me very
well; for a nimble little boy would often be handy
for me in the work about the kitchen, the well,
and the shed. He might look after the chickens,
too; I cannot call the man for all these little
services."</p>

<p>"Then I will go and get one," said the farmer,
reaching for his coat and his heavy cane. The
alms commissioner always knew of boys to hire;
he would go to him.</p>

<p>Now it happened that on that very day the
butcher had sent his delivery boy to the commissioner
with a message that a new place should be
found for the boy, as he himself had bought a cart
and would have no more need of him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>This boy was Renti. He was quite alone in the
world, having neither father nor mother nor any
one else who belonged to him. Where he had come
from no one knew.</p>

<p>Nine years before, on Laurentius Day, a tiny
baby boy, wrapped in a coarse cloth, had been left
on the doorstep of the church. The sexton, coming
to ring the bell for evening prayers, had found
a bundle at the door, and on discovering that it contained
a living child he had taken it to the pastor.
On the following Sunday the little boy was baptized,
and received the name of Laurence in honor
of the saint on whose day he had been found.
Then he was intrusted to the care of the old washerwoman
Katrina, who kept him clean and decent
as long as she lived. But she died after a few
years, and then Renti passed from one hand to
another. Sometimes he was treated kindly, sometimes
quite otherwise; up to the time of his tenth
year he had never known how it felt to have a
home, for he had never been kept more than a year
in one place. In the last few years, since he had
been able to do light work, he had gone to a new
place almost every three months, wherever people
happened to have need of him.</p>

<p>When the farmer of Lindenhof arrived at the
commissioner's, the latter was at his door and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
Renti was standing before him delivering the message
from the butcher.</p>

<p>The farmer did not notice the boy especially,
but began at once to state his wants, whereupon
the commissioner drew Renti forward and said:
"You have come at an opportune time. Here is a
boy ready to go right home with you. And he
will do what is right, won't you, Renti?"</p>

<p>The boy nodded his head. There was something
about him that the farmer liked.</p>

<p>"Then come along," said the farmer.</p>

<p>So Renti trotted along beside him. Barefooted,
with no other clothes than the little jean trousers
and coarse shirt he had on,&mdash;for his little jerkin
had fallen into rags,&mdash;Renti entered upon his life
at Lindenhof.</p>

<p>The farmer's wife looked out in surprise when
she saw her husband returning so soon with a boy.
She scrutinized the newcomer more carefully than
her husband had, for she knew the boy would be with
her a great deal of the time, and she was particular
as to the people she had about her. Renti had big
brown eyes that looked out upon the world and its
people with open, frank gaze. Thick brown hair
waved about his brow. The woman liked him.</p>

<p>"I'll manage somehow about his clothes," she
said to herself, for she surmised that the garments
he had on were his only ones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>On the following morning Renti was at once
sent out to take the cows to pasture. There he
met Gretchen, who had but a few days before been
initiated into the duties of herding and who was
very glad to find that she was to have a companion.</p>

<p>Into this new life for Renti there came a joy
that he had never known before,&mdash;he had found a
home. Out on the sunny meadow, under the alders
with Gretchen, the boy was happy. Joy shone in
his eyes from morning till night, and when he was
not talking to Gretchen he had to express his
happiness in singing or yodeling.</p>

<p>The farmer's wife was kind to him. She had
a neat suit&mdash;trousers and jacket&mdash;made for him
for Sundays, and a white shirt to go with it. Then
she taught him to wash carefully at the well every
morning, and he was pleased and willing about it
all, for he himself liked to look neat. In his little
room there was a real bed, such as he had never
had before, and no one was ever cross to him now,
as his former masters and mistresses had often
been. So Renti was as happy as the birds in the
air, and his whistling stopped only with their own
songs, and probably would have continued all night
if the housewife had continued her demands for
wood and water that long. He always did the
kitchen errands at night, for the housewife was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
systematic and wanted everything made ready for
the next morning.</p>

<p>Often when the boy's whistle was heard at night
in the stable, the shed, or the henhouse, the farmer,
hearing it, would say: "Do send the boy to bed.
His workday should be over by this time."</p>

<p>But the wife would answer: "Work never hurts
any one; he gets sleep enough, and his whistling
shows that he is not unhappy."</p>

<p>Then the farmer was satisfied, and his wife was
glad that she could have her own way with the boy,
and that he was cheerful and content. When winter
came she proposed that they keep him, for she
would have work for him when he was not in
school, and when spring came and they had to take
laborers she would have extra work in the kitchen
and would find the boy very useful. The work of
carrying meals to the field hands three times a day
was alone worth keeping him for.</p>

<p>In his various duties the boy was often with
Gretchen, for she had many of the same tasks as
he had, and the two estates ran side by side. In
the summer the children were sent to the fields
to glean after the harvesters. They had discovered
that it was much pleasanter to do this work together,
first in one field, then in the other, than
to do it alone. So it was with many of their tasks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
and they were much together. But they were happiest
when autumn came and they were sent to
pasture with the herds. Renti had become so
familiar with the life at Lindenhof that he knew
every cow by looks and disposition; he had become
so well acquainted with the hens that he could pick
out any egg and tell just where and when it had
been laid. It took close watching to keep track of
the eggs, for the hens liked to lay in secret places.
Every creature, large or small, that belonged to the
farm was more familiar to Renti than to the farmer
himself, or to any hired man that they had ever had
on the place.</p>

<p>At The Alders life went on in the same quiet,
orderly way as at Lindenhof. In fact, there had
always been great similarity in the manner of running
the two farms. In the stables there were
always eight cows, and if either of the farmers had
seen fit to have nine, then there would have been
no sleep for the other until he, too, had nine cows
in his stall; for it was an old custom to have
everything alike on the two farms.</p>

<p>The farmers were the best of neighbors, however,
and there never was a thought of unpleasant rivalry
between them. Each was content to have everything
remain just as it had always been in the fathers' and
grandfathers' and great-grandfathers' time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>It had happened, strangely enough, that on both
occasions when there was a christening party at
Lindenhof there was one on the same Sunday at
The Alders,&mdash;with this difference, however, that
the babies christened at Lindenhof were both girls,
while at The Alders they were boys. Hannes had
come first, and then, a year later, Uli,&mdash;the boys
being now in their twentieth and nineteenth years.
But the most important difference between the two
households was, that while the number of children
at Lindenhof remained at two, a third child had
come to the other family years afterward. A little
girl had made a late but by no means unwelcome
appearance, proving a great joy to the family as the
years went on. She was a winsome, happy child and
did credit to the careful training of her parents, for
they were proper people, both of the opinion that
their first care should be to educate their children
to a decent, orderly life.</p>

<p>Regularly on Sundays the family might all be
seen going to church together,&mdash;father and mother
in advance, with little Gretchen between them, and
Hannes and Uli behind, all in their Sunday clothes
and all looking so neat and honest that it warmed
the pastor's heart to see them filing into church.</p>

<p>As little Gretchen grew along in this well-ordered
life she won the heart of every one; for she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
pleasant and courteous at all times and sweet to
look upon, with her bright, laughing eyes, blue as
the cornflowers, and her long, blond braids like
the golden grain above them.</p>

<p>When she had reached her ninth year her father
said one day: "Gretchen is old enough, I believe, to
herd the cows this year, and we might get along
without a boy. It is hard to find one whom you
can trust, and Gretchen is a sensible child and the
cows are all gentle."</p>

<p>The mother thought that they might at least try
it. Uli would, of course, go with her for the first
day to see that she got along without any trouble,
and was not afraid,&mdash;for she was a slight little
thing, to be sure, to take care of the cows all
alone.</p>

<p>Gretchen herself liked the idea of going, and Uli
said: "She need not be timid. Our neighbors have
a herd boy who seems gentler than most boys, and
I will tell him to look after her."</p>

<p>So Gretchen started out a few days later, accompanied
by Uli. In the neighboring pasture Renti
was already at his post. Uli called him to the
stone wall and made him understand that if anything
should happen among the cows he must come
to Gretchen's assistance. In return he should have
plums and nuts when they came in season.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>Now Renti needed only this to complete his
happiness,&mdash;to have a companion in the meadow,&mdash;and
by the end of the first day the children were
such good friends that the boy would have gone
through fire and water for Gretchen's sake. A
more faithful protector could not have been found
for her.</p>

<p>So the children passed the autumn season in
daily companionship. When winter came they went
back and forth to school together twice a day.
Sundays they invariably spent together, for Renti
was treated as a neighbor because he belonged to
the household at Lindenhof. So he went to The
Alders every Sunday afternoon and stayed with
Gretchen until supper-time,&mdash;that had become a
matter of course. And every Sunday afternoon
had slipped by so fast that when it was over they
wished it were just beginning; they hadn't had
time for half their plans and projects. Renti was
skillful at carving wooden whistles and making lanterns
out of pumpkins, and Gretchen had a supply
of colored paper from which they manufactured
whole cities, including the inhabitants, and boats
with movable oars, and churches, and houses with
swinging windows.</p>

<p>Then came the work of spring and summer, and
the children met continually in the fields. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
they were not together each knew exactly where
the other was, what he or she was doing, and when
they would meet again.</p>

<p>Now autumn had come and the children were
enjoying happy days in the meadow. There had
been but few rainy days to keep Gretchen at
home, for the season had been unusually fair. In
wet weather Renti had to wander about alone, with
a feed sack wrapped about his shoulders to keep off
the rain. On such days he took care of Uli's cows
also, after the latter had brought them to pasture
in the morning. In this way he kept his pockets
full of nuts. When Gretchen came out on the
next day there was always a great deal to talk
over, about how the cows had behaved, about the
little birds in the alders and how they had crept
into their nests, and about the big crows that had
suddenly swooped down on the pasture, croaking
so hideously that Brindle, in sheer terror, had run
right into their midst, whereupon the whole flock
started up and flapped about, frightening Brindle
still more, so that she went galloping wildly about,
and Renti had to catch her and stroke her head
until she became quiet.</p>

<p>All these incidents were the subject of earnest
conversation when the children were together once
more under the alders. So the days passed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
there were no happier children in all the country
round than Renti and Gretchen.</p>

<p>October came, and the bright, sunny weather
continued until past the middle of the month, so
that the children still remained in the meadow all
day without feeling cold,&mdash;only they went home
rather early in the evening. On a Saturday afternoon
of the third week black clouds began to pile
up in the sky and the children started for home at
four o'clock. A sudden darkness had come on, and
a violent downpour of rain, or perhaps hail, seemed
about to break forth. Gretchen was quite downcast,
for she feared that snow and cold weather would now
set in and put an end to the herding. But Renti
was hopeful and thought that winter was still a
long way off. Monday would be fair again, he said,
and they would come out as usual.</p>

<p>They bade each other good night and hurried
home with their herds, for the first drops had
begun to fall and the sky was growing darker and
darker. Renti, after reaching the barn and tying
the cows in their stalls, scrambled about in all the
corners, as he did every evening, to find the eggs.
Presently he heard a furious storm beating down
upon the barn. The rain and hail and wind were
almost crushing the roof. He stood in the barn
door holding the eggs in his cap, for he was afraid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
they would be broken by the hail if he started for
the house.</p>

<p>While he stood there the farmer was looking out
of the kitchen window at the storm. His wife was
blowing the fire that had several times been put
out by the wind and rain. The farmer watched the
gusts sweep by and said: "I have been expecting
this. I've seen it coming for some time. It is
hard on the fruit trees. Well, this makes an end
of autumn and we may look for cold weather.
The farmer of Broadwood told me to-day that he
wants a boy for the winter. He means to get
along with one hired man and a boy, for he has
his two sons to help him. So I told him he might
have Renti."</p>

<p>"You did!" exclaimed the woman. She stopped
blowing the fire and looked around at him. "Why
did you tell him that? Shall I do my work alone
all winter merely to let the farmer of Broadwood
have a good boy?"</p>

<p>"No, no," said the farmer in conciliatory tones;
"I had no such thought. On the contrary, you
are to have better help than you have now,&mdash;a
young fellow who is stronger than Renti and can
be of more use to you. I have a great deal of
wood to cut this winter and shall need an extra
hand. A young fellow of seventeen or eighteen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>can do my work and can also help you in the
kitchen. I have my eye on one."</p>

<p>"I was satisfied with Renti," said the wife; "but
if you need an older hand we must give up the boy,
for we do not need three servants." Then after a
moments she added: "If Renti must leave us, I am
glad that he is to have a good place. I shouldn't
like to send him away without knowing what sort
of people he goes to, but the household at Broadwood
is well managed. But whom will you get in
his place? I hope it will be some one fit to have
in the kitchen."</p>

<p>"Yes, he will do very well," said the farmer.
"He is young enough to do little errands about
the house and kitchen, but at the same time strong
and sturdy. For carrying wood and water he will
be better than a little boy. To-morrow he is to
come along this way, and if we wish him to, he
will stay. They will expect Renti at Broadwood
to-morrow evening."</p>

<p>The wife thought this was hurrying matters
somewhat, but her husband explained that as the
herding season was now ended the wood felling
might as well begin at once.</p>

<p>So they decided to let Renti go on the morrow
and to keep the young man when he came, for the
wife remembered, after her husband had mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
the youth's name and described him somewhat, that
she had seen him once or twice, and that he came of
a decent family in one of the neighboring parishes.</p>

<p>The storm had now abated and the farmer went
out to see that everything was in order for the
night. At the same time Renti came running into
the kitchen with eager, happy face, holding out a
cap full of eggs toward the housewife.</p>

<p>"What a boy you are to find nests!" she said,
as she bustled about the hearth. "To-morrow you
are to go to Broadwood, Renti. There you will
have plenty of eggs to hunt, for they keep a large
flock of chickens, the finest in this whole region."</p>

<p>Renti stared at the woman and almost dropped
the eggs from his hand, but he did not utter a word.</p>

<p>"Lay the eggs on the table," said the woman;
"I haven't time to put them away now; and
bring in a stick of wood. You needn't go for
water while it rains so hard. Then come in to
supper."</p>

<p>Renti laid down his cap and went out to the
shed. He was paralyzed by the news he had just
heard; he could scarcely lift the stick of wood,
although he usually carried such a burden on a run.</p>

<p>The housewife looked at him questioningly. "I
believe you are tired, Renti. Come, eat your supper
and then go right to bed."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>At the table Renti never once looked up, and
for the first time since he came to Lindenhof he
had no appetite.</p>

<p>"He is tired; I noticed it awhile ago," said the
wife in answer to her husband's puzzled look,&mdash;for
the boy's spoon was not traveling back and forth
in its usual way, in and out of the big bowl of
sour milk.</p>

<p>"Pshaw! that wouldn't take away his appetite,"
said the farmer.</p>

<p>But Renti could not swallow his supper.</p>

<p>"Perhaps the storm oppresses him. Let him go
to bed," said the farmer.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; you'd better go to bed," said the
wife in friendly tones. "I will look after the shoes
myself. Go and have one more good sleep in your
comfortable bed."</p>

<p>Renti crept upstairs to his dear little room. He
felt as though a heavy weight were upon him; he
could hardly breathe. But after he was in bed and
everything about him seemed just the same as it had
always been, and always must be, he thought, he
breathed more easily. Something would surely happen
overnight to straighten the matter out. When
things had gone on so long and so smoothly without
change, they could not all be upset in one night. And
with this thought Renti finally fell asleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>Next morning, as the farmer and his wife returned
from church, Renti came out of the barn to meet
them as usual. On Sunday mornings, when he had
plenty of time to scramble about all the corners
of the barn, he always made new discoveries in
the way of hidden nests.</p>

<p>"Now go and put on your Sunday clothes,
Renti," said the wife. "After dinner you may run
over to The Alders and tell them 'God keep you,'
for you probably won't see them again for some
time. It is a long way to Broadwood. Then you
must come home for a timely start, so that you
will reach your new quarters before nightfall. It
would not look well for you to get there late."</p>

<p>Renti felt as though a thunderbolt had struck
him. The morning having passed in its usual quiet
way, just the same as all other Sunday mornings,
he thought that the danger must be over and that
things were to remain as of old. But now he was
to be sent away, after all! He put on his Sunday
clothes; dinner came and went, he knew not how;
he was as if stunned. After dinner he went to the
barn and sat down on the lowest round of the hay
ladder. There he stayed for hours without stirring.
He could not go to The Alders and tell them "God
keep you." No, no, no! he could not go away!
he could not!</p>

</div>




<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>
<p>The housewife, thinking he had done as she told
him, packed his clothes into a bundle and then
joined her husband in the sitting room, where they
always sat together on Sunday afternoons. Here
she waited for Renti to return.</p>

<p>When the clock struck half-past three and he
had not yet appeared, she said: "He is late. He
ought to be here by this time."</p>

<p>"He knows that it is Sunday, and that coffee
will be on the table at four o'clock. He will be
here," said her husband.</p>

<p>The wife went out to prepare the coffee. When
she returned with the tray Renti had not come.
She went to the door to look for him and called
his name. He answered from the barn.</p>

<p>"If you were back, why didn't you come in?"
she said. "Come and drink your coffee. It is
high time that you were started."</p>

<p>Renti came in and gulped down his coffee, but
he could not eat anything. The woman laid a
piece of the fresh Sunday <i>Kuchen</i> into his bundle
and held it out toward him.</p>

<p>"There, Renti; God keep you! Be a good boy
and do what is right. Come to see us some Sunday
and tell us how you are getting on," she said,
as she laid the bundle on his arm. He extended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
his hand to the woman, then to the man, without
saying a word; then he turned and went out.</p>

<p>The wife went as far as the outer door with him.</p>

<p>Renti left the house without looking back. Once
outside, he ran as fast as he could.</p>

<p>"It is better so, after all," said the woman, coming
back to her husband's side. "He might have
said a word of good-by; but it is better than if he
had been sad at going, for then it would have been
hard to send him away."</p>

<p>"You need not worry about him," said the farmer.
"Youngsters always like a change. He is glad to
get into something new."</p>

<p>Renti ran with all his might until he was beyond
the house and land of Lindenhof. Then he threw
himself down on the ground and wept and moaned
as though his heart would break. Not a gleam
of hope could he see before him,&mdash;not a ray of
comfort.</p>

<p>The sky was covered with stars when he finally
arose. Then he ran without stopping until he
reached Broadwood. It took more than half an
hour of fast running to cover the distance,&mdash;so
far away from home was his new life to be.</p>

<p>When Renti arrived at the lonely looking house
at Broadwood everything was quiet, and the door,
which in country houses usually stands open all
day, was sternly closed. As he approached, a big,
ugly dog darted out of his kennel toward him, barking
and growling angrily. Renti shrank back in
terror. Fortunately the dog was chained, for he
was in a fierce mood, being enraged at the arrival
of so late a visitor.</p>

<p>The door of the house opened and a rough voice
called out, "What's the matter out here?"</p>

<p>"It's&mdash;only I," Renti answered in trembling
tones.</p>

<p>"Who is 'I'?" said the farmer. "Come closer.
He will not eat you. Down, Turk!"</p>

<p>Renti came forward and said, "Good evening."</p>

<p>The farmer, seeing the bundle on Renti's arm,
said: "Ah! you are the boy from Lindenhof. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
pretty time to arrive! They surely sent you away
long ago. If you think we are going to allow you
to vagabond and come home when you please, you
are mistaken. Come in."</p>

<p>The farmer's wife had been trying to make out
with whom her husband could be talking at this late
hour. Every one else was in bed,&mdash;sons and farm
hands,&mdash;for here the rule was, "Early to bed and
early to rise." When she saw her husband come
in with a boy she understood who it was.</p>

<p>"Send him right up to bed," she said, as she
brought a little lamp and gave it to her husband.
"You will have to show him the way and light
his candle. To-morrow he will go without a light.
He is to sleep in the room with Matthew, the young
fellow."</p>

<p>The farmer led the way with his meager little
light, and Renti followed him to a small room under
the roof, where the hired man was already sound
asleep. Renti undressed quickly and slipped into
his narrow little bed; the farmer went away with
the light. Renti realized that the bed was harder
than the one he had slept in last, but this did not
trouble him long. He was very tired and in a few
moments was fast asleep. Then he thought he
was under the alder trees with Gretchen, and the
Broadwood steer came, and he charged down upon
it and rescued Gretchen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>There was more noise and bustle about this new
establishment than in the home he had just left.
The Broadwood estate contained a great deal of
woodland, and the farmer, with his three sons and
two hired men, worked in the woods all winter. In
the barn there was a team of stout horses besides
the cows, and sometimes even the bad-tempered
steer was put into harness, for there was much
carting and hauling to do.</p>

<p>Renti was expected to fetch and carry and make
himself useful in all the different kinds of work, in
the barn, wood lot, or house. The summer vacation
was over, and he was supposed to spend a number
of hours in school each day, but in this matter the
farmer was not very particular.</p>

<p>On Monday morning Renti was told to stay
about the barn and help the farmer. At noon he
was to carry dinner to the workmen in the wood
lot and was to stay there and help for the rest of
the day. Renti was quick, and being familiar with
the work about the barn, he got along very well
with his new master. At noon he carried a big
basket to the woods, and after the men had disposed
of the lunch they kept Renti busy running here and
there, wherever they needed him. Now he had to
push, now to pull, and to carry the tools back and
forth continually.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>But suddenly he disappeared. Loud voices called
him repeatedly, but he did not answer. The voices
grew angry; they threatened, they scolded, growing
harsher and harsher. Renti did not come; he was
by this time far beyond the reach of their calls. A
feeling had suddenly come over him so irresistibly
that he could not withstand it,&mdash;he must go to Lindenhof;
and he ran and ran, without stopping, until
he reached the barn. There he stopped and looked
about him. Yes, the place was all unchanged: the
big barn door was standing open, and he could hear
his cows inside pulling the hay out of their cribs;
his hens were scratching about as usual for seeds
and grain, cackling contentedly.</p>

<p>The feeling that this was no longer his home, that
he no longer belonged to the creatures he loved, was
more than Renti could stand. He crept out behind
the barn, where no one could see him, and threw
himself down on the ground, burying his face and sobbing
and moaning piteously. For a long time he lay
there; it was twilight when he arose. Then he ran
as fast as he could up to the pasture, and climbed
onto the little stone wall. The wind rustled through
the alder branches and shook dead leaves down upon
him; everything else was very quiet. Renti sat
motionless, staring into the twilight as though he
hoped to summon forth some figure that was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
there. Presently the church bell rang for evening
prayers. The sound must have aroused him. He
leaped to the ground and ran across the meadow
toward The Alders, where he stole around the
corner of the barn and looked over at the house.
Everything was quiet; not a person was in sight.
He stood there until he saw some one coming out
of the house. It was Hannes going to the barn.
Then Renti started off and ran home, but it was
quite dark when he reached Broadwood. When he
entered the house he saw that supper was over and
that the farmer, who was putting out his lantern,
had just come in from his last trip to the barn.
The farmer's wife stood beside him. She spoke
first. "Here comes the vagabond! Do you think
we are going to allow such conduct here? I wonder
that you have the face to come back!"</p>

<p>Then the farmer spoke. "Where did you learn
such tricks? I hear you ran away in the middle of
the day. Did they allow that at Lindenhof? Be
careful, my boy; if this happens again, you will rue
it. For this time I will let you off, because it is
your first day and you worked well this forenoon;
but don't try it again! Now go to bed. Supper is
over. Whoever is here in time sits down with us."</p>

<p>Renti went upstairs to his room. He did not
mind going without supper, now that he had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
to Lindenhof. The next day the farmer took him
into the potato field. Here he had to push the cart
and sort over potatoes, picking out the poor ones
and laying them in a separate heap for the pigs.</p>

<p>Everything went well through the morning.
Renti worked diligently and the farmer was pleased
with him. In the afternoon the wife said she wanted
Renti to help her in the garden. She was going
to put things in order for the winter and take up
the plants that were not to stay outdoors. Renti
proved especially quick at this work, for he had
always helped the mistress of Lindenhof in the
same task. He knew just what had to be done and
took up one thing after another, even before the
woman had a chance to direct him.</p>

<p>"How clever you can be when you want to!"
she said, half in approval, half in reproach. "Don't
you see how pleasant it would be if you would
only behave as you should? You know how to do
your work properly, and we are all friendly toward
you; but you must not run away."</p>

<p>At four o'clock the woman packed a lunch basket
and gave it to him. "Now carry the men's supper
out to them. They are at the edge of the wood and
it is not far. Come right back and you shall have
your own supper. But remember to come back
at once."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>Renti did not come back.</p>

<p>"Scalawag!" exclaimed the woman angrily, when
she found herself still working alone an hour afterward.
It was now growing dark, and she gathered
up her tools and went into the house.</p>

<p>When the farmer and his men came home to
supper Renti had not appeared.</p>

<p>"Now you must teach him who is master," said
the wife, after she had told her husband about
Renti.</p>

<p>"Yes, he shall learn it once for all," he replied.</p>

<p>Supper-time came and passed and the workmen
went to bed; only the farmer and his wife were
still busy with their last duties.</p>

<p>At length Renti appeared in the door.</p>

<p>"Straggler!" the farmer called out angrily.
"Where have you been roaming about?"</p>

<p>Renti said nothing.</p>

<p>"Can't you speak?" demanded the wife.</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>"Do you know what you deserve? There, now
perhaps you'll remember to-morrow!" said the
farmer as he boxed his ears sharply. "Now go
to bed."</p>

<p>On Wednesday Renti worked diligently, doing
carefully whatever task he was set to. He held
out bravely until twilight, then he disappeared.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
When the housewife wanted wood for her fire she
called him, but there was no Renti.</p>

<p>"What can we do with such a boy?" said the
farmer in despair when he heard this last report.</p>

<p>"I had my suspicions from the first," said the
wife accusingly, "when the farmer of Lindenhof
offered him to you so readily. I suppose his wife
had had enough of the rascal's tricks."</p>

<p>"He does his work very well when he is at it,"
said the man in a conciliatory tone; "but I really
am curious to know where he wanders about."
He opened the door once more and looked out.</p>

<p>"I am not," replied the wife. "I'm sure he has
fallen in with some good-for-nothing boys who go
tramping about the country, and that's why he
won't tell where he's been. And what if he does
work well? What good is he to us if he is always
gone when we need him most? No, we cannot keep
him if he goes on in this way."</p>

<p>Just as the farmer was about to lock the door
Renti came running in. He had to go without
supper, as on the previous night, and received a
worse punishment than before, and a stern warning
that if the offense was repeated something serious
would happen.</p>

<p>On Thursday the farmer said to his wife: "Let
him go to school to-day. There is nothing special
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>to do. Next week we shall have particular need of
him, and if he is out too many days we may get a
notice from the schoolmaster."</p>

<p>Renti went to school. He saw Gretchen for the
first time since they had parted in the meadow;
but he saw her only at a distance, for as soon as
school was dismissed the boys all ran off together
in one direction and the girls in another. That was
the way they always did at school,&mdash;except that
in the winter the boys ran after the girls and snowballed
them; but there had not been enough snow
for that this year. So at four o'clock Renti ran off
toward Broadwood without having spoken a word
to Gretchen. When he was halfway home and was
still running he suddenly felt some power seize him
from behind and turn him around. He faced about,
and the next moment was running back over the
same road faster than ever.</p>

<p>On the previous Sunday after church, when the
farmers usually met and exchanged news items,
Gretchen had heard that Renti was to leave Lindenhof
and go to Broadwood. She was so downcast
by the news that she did not speak a word at
dinner, and Uli said teasingly: "What's the matter
with you? Has your kitten run away again?"</p>

<p>But the mother said: "Don't bother her, Uli. She
feels sad about Renti, because he must go away."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>"Indeed, I don't think that's anything to feel
sad about," protested Hannes. "At Broadwood he
will be well provided for. It is one of the finest
farms in the country. I wish we had a team of
horses like theirs."</p>

<p>Gretchen felt certain that Renti would come in
the afternoon. He always came on Sundays, and
now that he was going away he would surely come
to say good-by, and then she would tell him to be
sure to come the next Sunday. But she waited for
him in vain. She went to the window again and
again to look for him, and still he did not come.
Gretchen was very sad at heart. At the supper
table her father remarked that it was not very mannerly
in Renti to go away without saying good-by,&mdash;and
that made her feel still worse.</p>

<p>Hannes and Uli agreed with their father and
said they would not have thought it of Renti; but
the mother suggested in her kindly way that perhaps
he had wanted to come but was kept at home
for some reason by the farmer or his wife.</p>

<p>For several days Gretchen had looked for Renti
at school, but in vain. She knew, however, that he
had left Lindenhof, for Uli had heard it directly
from the master of Lindenhof. But to-day he had
been at school. He had not spoken to her, and
she had only seen him sitting on his bench on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
other side of the room, and after school he had run
away with the other boys; but she was glad that
he had been there and that she knew at least this
much of him.</p>

<p>In the evening, when it was growing dark,
Gretchen's mother sent her to the well with the
bucket and told her to set it where Uli would see
it and bring it in filled when he came. As Gretchen
was coming back from the well she heard a strange
sound, like suppressed moaning. It seemed to come
from the barn, and she stood still and looked in
that direction, but could not distinguish anything
on account of the darkness. As she stood looking
she heard the piteous sound again. She was frightened
and ran toward the house.</p>

<p>Then she heard her name called, quite plainly,&mdash;"Gretchen!"
She knew the voice and ran toward
the barn.</p>

<p>There stood Renti with his face pressed against
the wall.</p>

<p>"Renti! is it you?" said Gretchen in pleased
surprise. "Why are you standing out here? Come
in. Mother is in the kitchen. And why are you
crying?"</p>

<p>"I can't come in; I am afraid. Everybody is
angry with me for running away. I suppose she
is, too."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>


<p><a name="I150"></a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 50%" >
<img src="images/150.jpg" alt="Why are you standing out here?... And why are you crying?" style="width: 80%" />
</div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>
<p>"Oh, oh! you went away without asking?"
cried Gretchen in sad, shocked tones. "But why
didn't you come on Sunday? You will surely come
next Sunday, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Last Sunday I couldn't come, and till next
Sunday is so long I can't wait. I have to run
away every day."</p>

<p>"Where do you run, Renti? I never see you."</p>

<p>"It is always late when I come, and then I have
to go right, back. And you are never here. I run
home every day to Lindenhof, and if no one is
there to see, I go into the barn and look down
through the feed holes at the cows. And Brindle
always knows me, and says 'Moo' when she sees
me. Oh, I can't endure it! I can't endure it!"
groaned Renti, pressing his face against the cold
stones as though to wring pity from them.</p>

<p>Gretchen's eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p>"If you run away every day, Renti, don't they
whip you?"</p>

<p>"Of course they do. They'll whip me to-day,
too."</p>

<p>"O Renti! then go home as fast as you can, or
they will be more and more severe with you. And
don't run away to-morrow, nor the next day, nor
any more, so that they won't whip you," entreated
Gretchen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't mind it very much," said Renti. "It
isn't so bad as not running away."</p>

<p>He was still pressing his face against the stones,
but at length Gretchen drew him away and entreated
him to go. It made her heart ache to think that
they would beat him, and she hoped he might be
spared if he ran very fast.</p>

<p>So Renti turned and darted off down the road.</p>

<p>Gretchen went in and told her mother all about
it,&mdash;how sorry she felt for Renti and how dreadful
it was that they should whip him. The mother
was sorry for the boy, too; but she said that he
must learn to reconcile himself to the change and
not run away any more. And she told Gretchen
to tell him, if she saw him again, that he would be
welcome on Sundays at The Alders, if they allowed
him to come, but that he would certainly not be
welcome if he ran away.</p>

<p>All this trouble about Renti lay heavy on Gretchen's
heart. The boy was kept out of school
the rest of the week. The farmer thought he
could thus keep better watch of him and prevent
his running away, until he was settled in the new
life and trained to its ways. But every day&mdash;usually
it was dark before he got a chance&mdash;he would
manage to slip out, and away he would shoot like
an arrow. The later it was when he escaped, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
later would he come home and the harsher would
be the punishment that awaited him. On Saturday
evening, after the boy had been chastised as
usual and sent to bed without supper, the farmer
told him: "I will give you one more week's trial.
If you do not improve I will send you away."</p>

<p>The next day the woman said to Renti: "This
afternoon you may go out with my permission;
but see that you come back at a reasonable time
for supper, as befits decent people."</p>

<p>Renti went away right after dinner, but he did
not go to The Alders. He thought the family had
probably heard of his running away, and he was
ashamed to go. And perhaps Gretchen's father
and her brothers would look accusingly at him and
make him feel that he was not welcome. He felt
the same way about the people at Lindenhof, and
not for anything would he have gone into their
house or let them see him.</p>

<p>It had begun to snow a little, and a cold, sharp
wind was whirling the flakes about him in eddies.</p>

<p>Renti ran up to the meadow and sat down on
the stone wall. He stayed there until it became
dark, although he was shivering with cold and the
wind almost blew him off the wall. When it was
so dark that no one could see him, he went down
to Lindenhof and wandered about the barn and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
stables like some restless spirit condemned to leave
a place and yet unable to tear itself away. Several
times he started toward home; then he would turn
back and go all around the barn once more, laying
his ear to the cracks and trying to hear some
dear, familiar sound from his cows or his chickens.
Finally he tore himself away and went over to
The Alders. At the corner of the barn he waited
a long, long time to see whether Gretchen would
come out; but she was nowhere to be seen, so at
last he ran off home.</p>

<p>The following week passed as the previous one
had. If on any one evening Renti found no chance
to run away, then he slipped out so much earlier
the next day. Several times he came home so late
that the farmer could not go to bed at his usual
time. Then the boy was punished with exceeding
severity, so that the farmer thought, "Surely this
will cure him." But it did not cure him.</p>

<p>On the second Sunday, when Renti came down
in the morning, the farmer said: "You may go
as soon as you have finished breakfast. The alms
commissioner knows you are coming; I told him
about you."</p>

<p>The wife packed his clothes in a bundle, and when
Renti rose from the table she gave him his package,
and he went accompanied by the parting injunction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
from both the farmer and his wife to "be better in
his next place than he had been with them."</p>

<p>Renti went on his way utterly indifferent; he
did not care where he might be sent next. When
he reached the commissioner's house the man had
not yet returned from church, so he waited. Presently
the man appeared, and seeing Renti at his
door, at once exclaimed: "What's this I hear about
you? A fine record you are making! You'd better
try to stay in your new place, for I don't know
what will become of you after the next three
months. The parish will not pay for you after that;
so think over the matter a little. Now you are to
go to the shoemaker's."</p>

<p>Renti felt that the commissioner did not feel
friendly toward him, as he had formerly. He
turned away in embarrassment and went on.</p>

<p>In winter the farmers did not usually take boys,
as they did through the summer, for their clothes
and keep, so no one had offered to take Renti on
these terms; but the shoemaker had agreed to
take him for a small sum to cover his board, since
he always had use for a boy.</p>

<p>When Renti presented himself at the shoemaker's
the man was sitting in the one room of
the house, with his wife and three small children.
He was mending a shoe, although it was Sunday.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose you are the new boy," said the
woman, when he presented himself. "Lay your
bundle in here. This is where you are to sleep,"
and she pointed toward the door by which he had
entered. Renti understood that he was to sleep in
the small cupboard-like opening that he had noticed
on the left of the door. It was shut off from the
rest of the room by a few narrow boards, with wide
cracks between them, these openings being the only
means by which light and air could enter the space.
Within, there was nothing but a straw bed and a
broken chair. This was to be Renti's bedroom.
He tossed his bundle on the chair and ran out.</p>

<p>The poor shoemaker had no order or system in
his household. He took Renti for the sake of the
little money he would get for him, and because he
needed some one to do his errands, as his own
children were too small to be of any use to him.
Aside from this he paid little attention to the boy
and let him go his own way. He sent him to school
mornings, because the boy's expenses were paid
by the community and he would have been called
to account if Renti had not gone to school; but in
the afternoon, if he had long errands, or any other
kind of work for him, he kept him out. In the
evening the shoemaker always sent him about
here and there, and Renti came home when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
pleased, no one paying any attention to him;
but he never found anything to eat then, for he
was always too late for the family supper, and of
course nothing was saved for him. The others
were glad that he did not come, for there was
hardly enough for the family, and if he had come
in time they would have had to give him something.
To have anything left over was a thing
unknown to them.</p>

<p>Renti was becoming sadly demoralized. In school
he never knew anything because he never studied
at home, being out every night. In appearance,
too, this thin, ragged little fellow was much changed
from the Renti of former days.</p>

<p>Gretchen was much worried about it all; her
days had become very unhappy. When she heard
the teacher saying so often, "Renti, you have become
one of the very worst boys in school," she
felt like sinking through the floor, for she always
felt as though it were she herself being thus disgraced.
She never had a chance to speak to Renti;
he always ran away right after school and seemed
to have grown shy and timid. She could not tell
her troubles at home, for as soon as she mentioned
his name her brothers would cry out, "Don't speak
of him; he's a good for nothing." And even her
mother would no longer take his part and say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
in her kind way, "He may turn out all right in
time."</p>

<p>Gretchen had but one hope,&mdash;that when Renti's
time with the shoemaker was over and he was once
more taken on a farm, where there was better management,
he would turn over a new leaf; for she
could not believe that he was really the good for
nothing that her brothers thought him.</p>

<p>Evenings she often wanted to go out to see
whether Renti might not be standing at the corner
of the barn; she wanted to console him and urge
him to do better; but her mother would never let
her go. She said that Renti should not be wandering
about at night, and if he had a clear conscience
he would find their door on Sunday afternoons.
If he didn't come then, Gretchen was not to watch
for him.</p>

<p>So on many and many a night Gretchen went to
bed with a heavy heart, and lay awake thinking of
some way by which Renti could be led back to the
right path.</p>

<small>WHAT GRETCHEN LEARNED AT SUNDAY SCHOOL</small></h3>




<p>The early days of March had come. In the
meadows the primulas and white anemones were
blooming, and in the fields the farmers were rushing
their spring work with all their might, for each
one wanted to be first to get his potatoes into the
ground. Plowing and sowing were everywhere waiting
to be done. There was much need of help, and
boys were in demand once more. So it happened
that Renti found a new place on the very next
day after he left the shoemaker. Early on Sunday
morning he started out with his little bundle; but
it was a very different bundle from the one that
he had brought with him from Lindenhof. He had
had nothing new since the day he left there, and
his old clothes were in rags. The little Sunday
jacket, once so neat and stout looking, was now
thin and shabby, and the fresh face and bright eyes
that had gone with the jacket when it was new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
wore quite a different look when Renti presented
himself at Brook Farm, his new home. The place
was so named because the farm extended along the
margin of a large stream that flowed through the
lower part of Buschweil. Renti reached the new place
quite early, before the farmer had started for church.</p>

<p>Gretchen was happy once more that Sunday
morning, for she had heard the alms commissioner
telling her father, as they came from church, that
Renti was to go to Brook Farm, and that it would
be a good change for the boy, as there was very
poor order in the shoemaker's household, and the
boy had probably not had much to eat.</p>

<p>Afterward, when they were sitting at dinner,
Gretchen's father began to speak of Renti. On
Sundays he was always more talkative at the table
than during the week, for that was the only day
when they had plenty of time to eat and did not
have to hurry back to work.</p>

<p>"Brook Farm," he said, "is an excellent place
for the boy. They do not keep a hired man there
and have few laborers; so he will be with the
farmer a great deal and right in his sight. Perhaps
he can thus be brought back to proper ways
and made to forget his runaway habits."</p>

<p>"I doubt whether he will ever be cured of his
vagabonding. What excuse had he for running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
away at Broadwood? He had a good place there,"
said Hannes impatiently; for it irritated him to
think of the two fine horses standing over there
in the barn, while in their own stalls there were
none, and he had always longed for one.</p>

<p>"Why should he run away anyhow?" Uli went
on. "Hannes and I never thought of such a thing,
and we had many a job that we did not exactly
like when we were going to school."</p>

<p>Hannes and Uli were both a little self-righteous.
They had always lived an even, proper life, and did
not reflect what it had been worth to them to have
a good, comfortable home and loving care.</p>

<p>"We must not lay it up against him that he
ran away sometimes," said the mother charitably,
"if he does right now. He is young, and has been
knocked about a great deal. If he falls into good
hands now, he may turn out all right."</p>

<p>Gretchen was very glad to hear her mother say that.
After dinner she ran out into the meadow to gather
primulas and anemones, and she remembered with
pleasure the times when Renti and she had gone out
together on Sunday afternoons to pick the flowers.
Perhaps he would come again, if he got back into a
proper life now and found he could do right once more.</p>

<p>All that day Renti roamed about, no one knew
where, for he took good care not to let any one see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
him. It was always the old places, however, that
he haunted. On Sundays he often sat for hours
behind the barn at Lindenhof, and there, hidden by
the wood pile, he would dig worms and grubs for
the hens and so coax them to him. They would
eat the morsels from his hand with evident pleasure,
cackling contentedly, just as they used to do
when they still belonged to him. But sometimes,
in the midst of his enjoyment, he would suddenly
press his face against the wood and sob piteously.</p>

<p>On Monday morning work began. He was kept
constantly under the farmer's eyes, as Gretchen's
father had said, for there was no one besides the
farmer and Renti to do the work in field and stable.</p>

<p>The wife had only two small children, and she
herself carried in wood and water for the kitchen.
So there was no twilight hour when Renti was sent
out on these errands, and consequently there was
no chance for running away.</p>

<p>After the field work and the evening chores in the
barn were finished the farmer would say, "Now
come in to supper and then go to bed."</p>

<p>The man rarely spoke to Renti, but the boy realized
very well that he was keeping close watch of
him. For a whole week there was no chance for
the least attempt at running away. The boy was
not sent to school, for the farmer said that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
early spring work was very urgent. All this produced
a strange effect on Renti: he felt possessed
by a passion to tear in pieces everything that was
put in his hands and trample it underfoot.</p>

<p>If the work that he was doing kept him behind
the farmer's back, he would suddenly throw down
his tools, clinch his fists, and stamp on the ground
like a madman. When the farmer turned round
he would snatch up his tools and fall to work; but
these strange performances did not wholly escape
the farmer's eye.</p>

<p>The boy was not nearly so apt in his work as he
had formerly been. If the farmer explained to him
how a thing was to be done, one step after another,
he paid little attention and forgot all the instructions
before he got half through the task. It was
plain that his thoughts were not upon the work,
for he would stand staring vacantly into space,
and sometimes his eyes would roll about in a wild
way as though he were engaged in some fierce
struggle.</p>

<p>"Keep your mind on your work and don't be so
clumsy," the farmer often told him, but it did no
good. Again he would warn him: "Be careful,
my boy; if you don't do better, you will be sorry
for it." But he did not improve. On the next Sunday
the farmer said, "You must stay at home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
to-day. If you go wandering about the country,
your head will be full of crazy notions all the week."</p>

<p>Renti could not get away, for the farmer remained
at home all day within sight of the house and barn,
keeping his eye on the boy until it was time to
milk the cows and feed them, and in these duties
Renti always had to help.</p>

<p>The following week was even worse than the
last one. Renti seemed possessed by some evil
spirit that gave him no rest. One day the farmer
directed him to sit down before the barn door and
cut some potatoes that were needed for planting,
he himself being busy in the barn where he could
keep an eye on the boy. Renti had done this work
before and knew very well that the potatoes must
be cut carefully so that each piece would have
the proper eyes for sprouting. But he went at
them regardless of eyes or sprouts, hacking right
and left with such fierceness that it seemed as
though he were taking vengeance on the potatoes
for some great wrong that they had done him. The
farmer came up softly behind the boy; the violence
of the latter's movements had made him suspect
that the work was not being done as carefully as
it should be.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" he said suddenly, right
behind the boy's chair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>Renti sprang up in alarm, upsetting the basket
with all the uncut potatoes, and these rolled down
into a cistern that the farmer had just uncovered,
all but a few disappearing in the hole.</p>

<p>Then Renti began to recover his senses, for he had
been sitting as if in delirium. He had not meant to
spoil the potatoes, but had simply not thought anything
about what he was cutting them for, and it relieved
his feelings to chop them with all his might.</p>

<p>"A pretty mess you've made!" said the farmer
angrily, as he contemplated the few small potatoes
that were left. "You are more expense to me than
you are worth. This comes of having your thoughts
always on vagabonding. But you're not going to
stir a step from the house,&mdash;you may count on that.
Struggle as you please, you will finally learn to
be patient."</p>

<p>These words made Renti feel as though the
farmer had fastened a chain to him and bound him
down. After that he grew more restless and more
erratic than ever. He was continually looking about
for some way of escape, and whatever he did was
so carelessly done that the farmer more than once
took him by the ear and said, "Careful, careful!
This can't go on much longer."</p>

<p>On Saturday evening, at milking time, the farmer
went into the barn, with Renti following as usual.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>"You haven't brought back the bucket since it
was scrubbed at the well," he said impatiently; for
he had already tied the cow's tail so that she would
not switch it in his face while he was milking.
"Run and fetch it, and be quick!"</p>

<p>Renti ran out. Once outside the door he flew
like an arrow over the fields. A few moments
afterward the farmer rose from his milking stool,
where he had been sitting waiting, and went to the
door. The well was just outside: there stood the
bucket, upside down, as it had been left to dry, and
Renti was nowhere in sight.</p>

<p>"Tricky little scamp! This is the last I'll have
of you!" muttered the farmer in rage, as he went
out to get the bucket.</p>

<p>Renti ran without stopping until he reached the
path leading to Lindenhof. Then he paused; he
happened to think that it was just the time when
the men would be busy about the stables. So he
turned about and ran toward The Alders.</p>

<p>"Renti, Renti! wait!" he heard a voice calling
behind him. He turned about and saw Gretchen
coming toward him with smiling face. She was very
glad to see Renti once more and wanted to hear from
him that he was getting on well in the new place and
that everything was going to turn out happily,&mdash;for
this was what she confidently expected to hear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>But when she came up with him and looked into
his face she said in alarm, "Renti, what is the
matter with you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," was the answer.</p>

<p>"But you are so changed. Are you out on an
errand? Were you coming to our house?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You haven't run away again, Renti, have
you?"</p>

<p>Gretchen looked at him in distress.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have."</p>

<p>Gretchen grew pale.</p>

<p>"Oh, oh! now you are doing it again, and
everything will go wrong! What will the farmer
do to you when you go back?"</p>

<p>"I don't care what he does. I'd like to chop
down all his trees!"</p>

<p>That seemed to Renti the most awful injury that
one could do to an enemy. He had once heard
of a servant who, in a fit of anger, had cut down
his master's tree, and Renti remembered what a
dreadful impression this had made on every one;
for a fine old tree, that has stood from one generation
to another, giving its yearly offering of fruit, is
looked upon with special reverence by the farmers.
Renti uttered this hideous wish with clinched fists
and set teeth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>


<p><a name="I168"></a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 50%" >
<img src="images/168.jpg" alt="I'd like to chop down all his trees!" style="width: 80%" />
</div>




<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>
<p>Gretchen was very sad. "I never saw you like
this, Renti. You are surely getting bad again,"
she wailed, "and everybody will turn against you,
and there won't be any possible help for you."</p>

<p>"No; no help at all," groaned Renti.</p>

<p>The church bell sounded for evening prayers.</p>

<p>"I must go home," said Gretchen hastily. "Our
happy days are over. Good night, Renti."</p>

<p>"Yes; and all my life long I can have no more
pleasure. Good night, Gretchen."</p>

<p>Renti ran across the fields toward Lindenhof,
and Gretchen went her way with a sad heart.</p>

<p>On the following day, a bright Sunday in spring,
when all the fields lay smiling and sparkling, Gretchen
stood at the corner of the house and would
not go in to dinner, for she feared that now they
all knew that Renti had been running away again;
and what would her father and brothers say? Her
mother called a second time and she reluctantly
went into the house.</p>

<p>She was not kept long in suspense. As soon as
her father had laid down his soup spoon, he said:
"Well, now it's over with Renti. I heard to-day
at church that he had been sent away from Brook
Farm. The farmer says he cannot keep him
because he is good for nothing, and that it would
be useless for any one else to try him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>"But where will he go, father?" asked Gretchen
timidly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps they will take him to the poorhouse,
as they did Yoggi, the idiot boy. There he will be
mastered," Hannes informed her with a triumphant
air. "They won't expect him to work, but if he
doesn't stop running away they will tie him down
until he grows tame."</p>

<p>"It's what he deserves," declared Uli, with self-righteous
assurance.</p>

<p>"I am really disappointed in the boy," said the
mother. "I was always fond of him and hoped
he would turn out a good boy in time; but if he
doesn't behave anywhere, it is a bad sign and shows
there must be something wrong with him."</p>

<p>Gretchen could hardly keep back her tears.
Everybody was against him now, even her mother,
and she dared not say a word in his behalf. Then
when she remembered how strangely he had behaved
the evening before, she grew more and more
troubled, and thought that perhaps he had really
fallen into evil ways. And she could not help him,
and no one else could help him. She could hardly
choke down the last mouthful, and left the table
before dinner was over, asking permission to go out.</p>

<p>"Yes, but do not stay out late," her mother
said, as she always did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>Gretchen ran up to the pasture, where it was
quiet, and where very few people ever came. When
she reached the stone wall she sat down under the
shade of the alders and thought over the whole
matter about Renti,&mdash;how he seemed to be going
from bad to worse and how hopeless everything
seemed. The tears that she had held back so long
began to flow down her cheeks, and while the birds
in the alder tree were singing their merriest songs
she sat underneath and wept as though her heart
would break.</p>

<p>Presently she heard some one approaching; she
dried her tears and kept very quiet. Looking down
over the meadow, she saw the pastor coming toward
her. On Sunday afternoons he often took this
walk up the hill to enjoy the fine view one got from
there over the surrounding country.</p>

<p>Seeing Gretchen sitting all alone on the stone
wall, he stopped in surprise and spoke to her. She
arose at once and gave him her hand. He looked
at her in silence for a moment; then, patting her
shoulder in a friendly way, he said: "Gretchen,
Gretchen, what is the matter with your bright eyes?
Don't you hear the birds singing and giving thanks
for this beautiful Sunday?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Herr Pastor, I hear them."</p>

<p>"And can you not be happy with them?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, I cannot," she said in a voice that was
almost a sob.</p>

<p>"Are you in trouble, Gretchen? Come, tell me
about it. Can't you?"</p>

<p>Gretchen for a moment made no reply; then
she said in a low voice, "No."</p>

<p>"I think I understand," said the pastor sympathetically.
"Sometimes things will happen that we
don't care to talk about,&mdash;some little difference
with brothers, or some misunderstanding at home.
It frets and grieves us, because we see no way of
ever straightening it out and being happy again;
but, Gretchen, don't you remember the lines you
recited in Sunday school a week ago?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Herr Pastor," answered the child without
trepidation; for she was not one of those who
learned her verses the last minute before Sunday
school and then forgot them as soon as she was
out of church. She studied them carefully and
conscientiously, so that she would be sure of not
breaking down in church.</p>

<p>"Won't you come here and say them for me
now?"</p>

<p>The pastor seated himself on the wall and motioned
Gretchen to a seat beside him. She willingly
obeyed, and clasping her hands she said with
reverent air:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i-1">"Sing, pray, walk in His way,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Do your work as for the Lord;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He will help you when the world<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Naught of comfort can afford.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">For if your faith be sure,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And your courage endure,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">God will be your friend."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"That is very good; but have you ever thought
what the poem means, Gretchen?" asked the
pastor.</p>

<p>"I have repeated it ever so many times, so that
I could say it without stumbling," said Gretchen.</p>

<p>"You have learned it very well indeed," said
the pastor; "but I mean something more than that.
Let us see what it says: 'Sing,'&mdash;that is, be
happy like the birds, and do not lose courage or
hang your head; 'pray,'&mdash;that you must do to keep
happy. 'Do your work as for the Lord,' and you will
feel that God is with you, and will help you when
no one else in the world can. Now think about it,
Gretchen. And good-by."</p>

<p>Smilingly the pastor held out his hand to the
child, and then went on up the hill.</p>

<p>Gretchen had listened with deep attention to all
that he had said, and now as she sat thinking of
his words a great weight seemed to be lifting from
her heart: she had found comfort. She would do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
just as the pastor had said; and she repeated the
poem again, slowly and thoughtfully, trying to
remember all that he had told her. When she
reached the last lines she said them out loud joyously
and confidently:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i-1">"For if your faith be sure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And your courage endure,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">God will be your friend."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then she heard the birds singing in the alder
trees, and she suddenly felt like joining in their
song. The evening sun was spreading its golden
light over the meadow, and Gretchen saw that it
was time to go home. She jumped from the wall
and walked down the hill toward home, singing a
happy song as she went.</p>

<small>HOW RENTI LEARNS A MOTTO</small></h3>




<p>The alms commissioner had tried hard to have
them keep Renti awhile longer at Brook Farm,
for he did not know what else to do with the boy.
There was no room for him in the poorhouse, and
since everybody declared him utterly useless for
work, there was no prospect of finding another
place for him. The parish was not willing to
pay for him in the summer, as it did through the
winter. The farmer at first vowed he would have
nothing more to do with the boy, but at last consented
to keep him a week or two longer. The
field work would be increasing throughout the summer,
and perhaps after a while a place would be
found for Renti,&mdash;if not in Buschweil, where
everybody knew the boy, then perhaps in some
neighboring parish.</p>

<p>So for the present Renti remained at Brook
Farm; but he had a miserable time of it, for the
farmer was harsh toward him for having succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
in running away on the Saturday before in spite of
all his vigilance. Nor did Renti improve in his
work; so he got nothing but harsh words, and he
grew uglier every day.</p>

<p>The season was an exceptionally bright and
sunny one, so the spring work could be carried on
without interruption. The farmers who had plenty
of help might count on a rich harvest, for they were
able to get their seeds in early, and the warm sun
promised rapid growth.</p>

<p>The last farm in the parish of Buschweil was
Stony Acre. In fact, it lay partly in the next parish,
but the family came to church in Buschweil. They
lived a stern, arduous life at Stony Acre. From
early morning till late at night the farmer, with his
five sons and two hired men, were abroad plowing
and sowing, while the wife went out into the
bean field, with a maidservant and a day laborer,
and superintended the digging of holes and the
planting of the beans. When noon came she would
hurry home, get dinner, then run to the stables and
feed the stock, and then out into the bean field
again; and so on all day long without stopping, for
she was known to have more energy and endurance
than any other woman in the community.</p>

<p>But "to be everywhere at the same time is
impossible," she said to her husband one evening.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
"I must have a boy. When you begin work in
the outlying fields and can't come home to dinner,
how shall I cook the meals and carry them out to
you, and at the same time be here to feed the
cattle and look after the house?"</p>

<p>"Get a boy," said the farmer. "Choose one yourself
and you will be better satisfied."</p>

<p>But there was little choice for her. Far and near
there was not a boy to be had except Renti, and
he had the reputation of being so stubborn and ugly
that no one could manage him.</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said the woman when this was told
her; "I'd like to see the boy I couldn't manage.
I've brought many an older one to terms, and
we'll see how long it takes to make this youngster
toe the mark."</p>

<p>She immediately sent word to Brook Farm that
she needed a boy and that they might send Renti.</p>

<p>When people heard that the boy was to go to
Stony Acre they said that this was the last chance
of his ever amounting to anything, for if any one
in the world could discipline him, this woman could.
She had tamed many a wild fellow, and if anything
could be done with Renti, she was the one to do it.</p>

<p>Renti presented himself on the same day that he
was sent for. The woman happened to be all alone
that afternoon, and was sitting out in front of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
house picking over seed peas. Beside her lay a big
watchdog, who growled at the slightest noise and
sprang up barking furiously when Renti appeared.</p>

<p>"Be quiet!" the woman commanded him. Then
turning to Renti, she said: "Come this way. He
will not hurt you if you do nothing wrong. It is fortunate
that I have this opportunity of speaking to
you quietly before the others come, for I have something
to say to you. You see I've heard about your
tricks, my boy, so you must not try any of them here,
for the first time you run away you'll get a thrashing
such as you never dreamed of. What do you
say to that?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Renti in stubborn tones.</p>

<p>"Nothing? You mean to defy me? What did
you do before when you got a good thrashing for
running away?"</p>

<p>"I ran away again the next day."</p>

<p>"Indeed? Then that was all the good it did?
Well, I know something better that will surely cure
you." The woman called to the dog,&mdash;"Nero!"&mdash;and
pointing her finger at Renti, said, "Watch!"</p>

<p>The dog growled angrily and made a dash at the
boy; but the woman held him by the collar, and
Renti shrank back in alarm.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="I179"></a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 50%" >
<img src="images/179.jpg" alt="The dog will understand instantly, you may depend upon it" style="width: 80%" />
</div>




<p>"I see you understand," the woman said to
Renti. "Now the dog has learned his lesson, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>hereafter, when you carry dinner out into the fields,
or go on the slightest errand, he will go with you;
for I can't be watching you&mdash;I have other things
to do. If you make any attempt to get away, the
dog will understand instantly, you may depend upon
it. He will seize you by the neck, and if he wanted
to kill you, there would be no help for you. Do
you think you understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the boy in timid tones, for he
trembled at the thought of his fierce guard.</p>

<p>"Now as to your work. If you do your tasks
properly, all will be well; if not, remember that I
have taken others by the ears. So make your plans
accordingly."</p>

<p>After these preliminaries the woman told him
what his duties would be. That very evening he
was sent out to the fields with supper for the men,
and the dog went with him, never for a moment
stirring from his side. Renti saw that there would
be no more chance of running away.</p>

<p>The following week was a hard one for the boy.
But he himself had now grown hard. He never
was so stubborn before. At Lindenhof he had
never felt like being insolent; but now, when the
woman would say to him, "Why do you stand
there staring into space? why don't you go on with
your work?" he would answer sullenly, "Because."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
And when she called out to him, "Be quick, or
I will come and help you!" he would say, "Who
cares!"</p>

<p>One day, when she had set him to weeding the
garden, he went about it so fiercely that she stopped
to watch him. He drove his hoe into the ground
so hard that he could scarcely pull it out, thus
giving vent to his inner rage. She called to him
to be careful, or he might be sorry. He muttered
angrily that he didn't care what happened.</p>

<p>More than once he was taken by the ears for his
saucy answers. It was a week full of secret rage
on the boy's part, and of indignation and angry
outbursts on the woman's part.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning after church, when her
acquaintances gathered about her, all anxious to
hear how she was getting on with the boy, she exclaimed
over and over: "He drives me frantic! I
don't wonder that no one would take him. Such
a sulky, impudent rascal&mdash;you wouldn't believe
it unless you heard him. And his work doesn't
amount to anything. But I will not give in until
I master him."</p>

<p>Then the women all agreed among themselves,
"He must be a bad one," and told their husbands
when they got home, "If she succeeds in bringing
him to time it will be a miracle."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>In the afternoon Renti was told to carry some
tools that needed repairing down to the smithy.
"As it is Sunday, you may stay out until five
o'clock; but see that you get home in time. If
you are not here at five, you will regret it."</p>

<p>Renti took the tools and went. He had but to leave
them at the smithy, so that they might be repaired
in the morning, and thus no precious time would be
taken from the working hours for this errand.</p>

<p>Ridding himself of his load as quickly as possible,
Renti was off and away into the sunny afternoon.
He would go and visit the pasture once more, and
the little stone wall, and the alder trees. While he
was yet at a distance he saw that Gretchen was
sitting on the wall. As soon as she saw him she
came running eagerly toward him.</p>

<p>"How nice that you have come once again!"
she called to him. "It is so long since I have heard
anything of you! It is Sunday, and you could come
to-day without running away, so we will be happy
all the afternoon."</p>

<p>They had reached the wall; Gretchen seated herself
upon it, and Renti stood before her.</p>

<p>"No, I did not run away," he said sullenly; "but
at five I am to be back. I won't do it, though; the
dog isn't here, and I won't go home until dark; I
don't care what happens."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>"O Renti! are you beginning your bad ways
again?" wailed Gretchen. "They said that at Stony
Acre you might be made to behave; but now
you mean to disobey your mistress, and you will
get a whipping, and everything will be as bad as
before."</p>

<p>"It has been all the time," Renti replied, casting
wild looks about, and growing more and more
violent in his speech as he proceeded. "If she
wants to thrash me, I don't care; and if she wants
to pound me to death, so much the better. It's all
over with me anyway. If I could only chop down
every tree on her whole farm!"</p>

<p>"O Renti, Renti! do not say such things!" cried
Gretchen in terror; for she saw in imagination the
hideous wish fulfilled, and all the beautiful trees
lying prone upon the ground. "If you yield to
your temper in this way, you will grow worse and
worse, and finally&mdash;yes, Renti, father said that
if you did not mend your ways it would go hard
with you. Oh, if you could only be good again, as
you used to be!" And Gretchen covered her face
with both hands and broke out into bitter weeping.</p>

<p>Renti threw himself on the ground, moaning:
"I can't be good any more; I don't know how,
and there isn't any hope for me, and I'd like to
die this minute!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Gretchen dried her eyes and said earnestly:
"There is help for you. If you had faith, and would
pray, you would feel at once that God was your
friend."</p>

<p>"But how can God help me?" groaned Renti,
with his face still buried in the ground.</p>

<p>"I don't know, but I'm sure the dear God knows,
and if <i>he</i> would help you, you might be good again,
as you used to be, Renti. Oh, I can't bear to see
you so changed! Do, for my sake, Renti," pleaded
Gretchen, entreatingly; "do try to be good! Then
we shall all be happy again."</p>

<p>"Then I will," said Renti, rising from the ground;
"if you won't cry any more, and won't be angry
with me for having been so bad."</p>

<p>"No, indeed; indeed, I won't!" Gretchen assured
him. "But I wasn't angry, Renti; I was only sad;
and if you will do now as you have promised, what
good times we shall have!"</p>

<p>"Do you really think so?" Renti asked doubtfully,
for he could think of nothing that would ever make
him happy again. "But, Gretchen," he said after a
moment's reflection, "what can I do for my mistress
to make things come as you say?"</p>

<p>"You must obey at once when she speaks to
you, and you must do your work properly. You
know very well how it should be done, if you only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
keep your wits about you. And whenever bad
thoughts come into your head about running away
and about chopping down trees, you must pray.
Then the dear God will help you when there is no
other comfort. You know the poem says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i-1">"For if your faith be sure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And your courage endure,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">God will be your friend."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Renti listened attentively to all that Gretchen
said. After thinking the matter over, he said resolutely,
"Yes, I will try; but will you come here to
the stone wall next Sunday afternoon, so that I can
tell you how I have succeeded?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I will come," Gretchen promised him; "but
you must not come unless you have permission, else
you will spoil it all again. Now you must go home;
it struck four a long time ago."</p>

<p>Renti had heard it and knew that it was time to
go, but he thought he could stay until Gretchen gave
warning. Wishing to show that he was in earnest
about his promise, he immediately held out his hand
to her and said, "Good-by." Then he ran down
across the meadow as fast as he could, and never
paused until he found himself at Stony Acre.</p>

<p>When his mistress saw him she said: "It's well
that you didn't try to play any of your tricks to-day.
Nero was ready to go after you."</p>

<small>ALL BUSCHWEIL IS AMAZED</small></h3>



<p>Monday came, and the work of another week
began.</p>

<p>"I wonder what has got into the boy now!" said
the housewife, casting suspicious glances at Renti
several times during the day. On Tuesday it was
the same, and the woman at length exclaimed:
"What can be going on in his head? I don't know
what to make of him."</p>

<p>Renti never answered a word. He gave no more
saucy retorts; his impudence was gone; but he
looked as though he were being crushed to the
earth by some awful burden. He had to struggle
continually to keep his promise. To do at once as
he was told, to practice self-control, to keep back
saucy answers, required such exertion on his part
that his head was bent low under the strain and
he hardly saw what was going on about him. Then
it was very difficult, too, to keep his thoughts upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
his work, so that he could do it properly, for he
had to pray away the temptations to do bad things.
What prayer could he think of quick enough to
conquer them? Then he remembered Gretchen's
verses, and whenever bad thoughts threatened to
rise he would say:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i-1">"For if your faith be sure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And your courage endure,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">God will be your friend."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But sometimes the thoughts rushed over him so
suddenly that in his excitement he could not remember
the verse, and he would have to stop and
think and at the same time keep on with his work.
All this was such a strain upon the boy that he
grew pale and lost his appetite.</p>

<p>"He is an artful hypocrite," said the woman,
when Wednesday came and Renti continued as he
had begun on Monday. "If I could only make out
what it is he's plotting. I have conquered many
another fellow, but I never saw one like him."</p>

<p>When Renti continued the same on Thursday
and Friday, keeping his eyes on the ground, speaking
never a word, and growing paler and paler,
the woman stopped scolding. She began to feel
queer about the boy. She watched him anxiously
from the corner of her eye, as though she were in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
constant fear of some new outbreak. On Saturday
Renti scarcely tasted food; and then a hideous
thought occurred to her: What if the boy had eaten
some of the rat poison from the kitchen cupboard!</p>

<p>She immediately began questioning him: "Do
you feel sick? Answer quickly! Have you pain?"</p>

<p>"No," said the boy, without lifting his head; he
was still struggling.</p>

<p>"There is something uncanny about him. Perhaps
he is a vampire!" she thought, in sudden
terror. She had once heard of a person whom no
one dared to look upon because he was a vampire.
"I wish I had never laid eyes on the boy!" she
exclaimed, incensed at her own weakness; and she
darted about all day as though driven by an evil
spirit. For the first time in her life she felt helpless.
The idea of not being able to master a young
boy seemed absurd, but she was really so uncomfortable
about him that she would much rather have
had nothing more to do with him. She would go
to church to-morrow, at any rate, and tell her friends
what a time she was having, and what a strain it
was on one's patience. That would be some relief,
she thought.</p>

<p>As soon as church was out a group of people
gathered about her, all curious to hear how she
was getting on with the boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>Then she poured forth her tale, growing quite
breathless in the eagerness of her telling. "Yes,
yes; if you only knew him! He is deep, I can
tell you. Control him? If you could do that, you
could work miracles. Since Monday he has taken
a new turn. Now he doesn't say a word,&mdash;gives
no answer, but hangs his head to the ground and
broods all day. What he may be hatching out will
come to light soon enough. Of course we can't tell
what it may be; but," she continued, with a mysterious
nodding of the head, "there is something
queer about the boy. I will not say what I think.
You will find out for yourselves."</p>

<p>At that the mistress of Lindenhof stepped forth
from the group, and, confronting the woman of
Stony Acre, said in distinct tones that were heard
by all those present: "I want to say a few words
in this matter. A week ago the complaint against
the boy was that he gave back saucy answers and
was insolent in his speech; to-day it is that he
gives no answer and says nothing. So I should like
to ask what he could do to be satisfactory? It
seems to me that if the boy is getting so bad,
there must be some cause in the treatment he
receives."</p>

<p>The mistress of Stony Acre started up as though
a wasp had stung her. "In my opinion," she replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
angrily, "it is much easier to send away a boy when
he grows troublesome than it is to take one whom
no one else wants. What do you think?"</p>

<p>The woman of Lindenhof answered in calm and
measured tones: "It was not on account of his
behavior that I sent the boy away, but simply because
we had made other arrangements about our
help. As long as Renti was with us he was a
good boy, and I should not mind taking him back
this very day."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said her angry opponent. "Words
are cheap and make a good sound. Many another
mistress would find it best to 'make other arrangements'
to get rid of such a boy."</p>

<p>Then the other held up her head stiffly and said,
as she looked the angry woman squarely in the
face: "I am ready to stand by my words. Here
before these people I say that I am not afraid to
take the boy back into my house; and I will prove
it." With that she passed out of the group and
went away.</p>

<p>"She means what she says; she will do it," said
one woman. Another said: "I am curious to see
how the affair will turn out. Do you think she will
master him?"</p>

<p>The excitement over the matter grew, and partisanship
for and against the contestants drew forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
many different opinions. Some said, "She of Lindenhof
will never do it; she will leave the boy
where he is." Others said, "If she does take him,
she will get rid of him before long; for if he is too
much for the woman of Stony Acre, he will never
be conquered by her of Lindenhof."</p>

<p>The wives all went home so excited that their
husbands became interested, too, and in all Buschweil
that day people were talking of the probable
outcome of the matter between Renti and the two
women who had quarreled over him.</p>

<p>Gretchen's mother alone of all the women had
not stopped after church, but had gone directly
home with the rest of her family; so at The Alders
they knew nothing of the occurrence.</p>

<p>The mistress of Stony Acre came home in a bad
mood; the encounter had been extremely irritating
to her. Never before had she been accused of treating
her servants badly. How dared any one suggest
such a thing to her?</p>

<p>The first person she saw on entering the house
was Renti. He was sitting on a stool in the kitchen
paring potatoes, as she had directed him to do. All
the morning he had had but one thought, which he
had been turning over and over in his mind,&mdash;that
this afternoon he was going to find Gretchen by the
stone wall, and tell her how obedient he had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
all the week and how hard he had tried to do right,
and she would surely be very much pleased.</p>

<p>"You are not going to stir a step from the house
to-day," the woman exclaimed as she entered the
room. "You went last Sunday, and I'm sure your
vagabonding did you no good."</p>

<p>It was a hard blow for Renti. All through his
struggles during the week he had looked forward
to Sunday afternoon; and now&mdash;he must stay at
home and face another long week like the last one.
At the thought a sudden flame of anger blazed up
within him and he muttered between his clinched
teeth, "What you deserve is to have all your trees
and your house and your barn and your cattle"&mdash;"chopped
down," he was about to say; but suddenly
he saw Gretchen before him and remembered how
she had wept and entreated. He made a tremendous
effort, struggling as never before to recall his verse,
and then finally, when it came to him, saying it over
and over,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i-1">"For if your faith be sure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And your courage endure,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">God will be your friend,"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>until the evil thoughts were banished.</p>

<p>When the afternoon sun lay bright and pleasant
on the meadows the mistress of Lindenhof stepped
forth in Sunday array from her door. She stopped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
on her way through the garden to pick a fine red
carnation, and with this in her hand she went out
into the road, and then across the fields. Her face
showed that many thoughts were at work in her
mind. She realized that the errand before her was
one of consequence. She had involved herself that
morning in something for which she had not planned;
but one word had led to another, until she had at
last committed herself to a statement that she did
not want to take back,&mdash;for she always stood by
her word. When she told her husband of what had
happened, he agreed with her entirely, and said:
"Of course you must take the boy. If he proves
too much of a trial, we will send him to our son-in-law,
who is young and strong and has several
hired men, and among them they will manage the
boy. I will gladly let them have the fruit of one or
two of our trees in the fall to make up for it, rather
than to have noise and wrangling in the house."</p>

<p>The wife thought this all over, but the calm serenity
with which she usually ended her reflections was
not within her reach to-day. She could not dispose
of the problem so easily as her husband had, for
she had made up her mind to keep the boy, no
matter how wild, or lazy, or unmanageable he might
be. The woman of Stony Acre should not have
the satisfaction of seeing her defeated; nor did she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
wish it said by the other women that she made
statements that she could not carry out.</p>

<p>But if the boy had really grown so wild and stubborn,
what would become of the peace of her home,
and her quiet, orderly life? This thought made her
uncomfortable, for she disliked harsh words and
rude manners; they were unknown in her household.
When she thought of Renti, however, and of
what a good boy he had formerly been, she said to
herself: "He cannot be altogether bad. He is still
young, and God willing we will make something of
him yet. Kindness and reason will accomplish a
great deal."</p>

<p>She had now reached Stony Acre. As she entered
the living room she saw that the housewife
was sitting alone; the other members of the family
were all out. Some had not come home and others
were in the stables feeding the stock.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the hostess stiffly; "it is an uncommon
honor to see you here. Will you sit down?"</p>

<p>"I have come to keep my word," answered the
visitor in firm tones, without noticing the proffered
seat.</p>

<p>"Indeed? You are in earnest?" And the hostess
tried to twist her mouth into a smile. "The boy is
in the barn; I will call him." She went toward the
barn, the other woman following her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>Upon hearing his name called, Renti appeared in
the barn door. When he saw the mistress of Lindenhof
he started impulsively toward her, but suddenly
checked himself, and hanging his head came
slowly forward; for his first joy at seeing the
mistress with whom he had once been so happy
immediately gave place to the conviction that she
must be angry with him, as everybody else was, for
having been so bad. She had noticed his start of
joy, however, and now held out her hand toward
him smilingly and said, "Come, Renti; you need
not be afraid."</p>

<p>"He probably has good reason for being afraid,"
said the woman of Stony Acre sharply.</p>

<p>He felt that he had indeed, and his head
dropped lower and lower. The visitor watched
him closely.</p>

<p>"Renti," she said, "what do you say to going
home with me?"</p>

<p>Renti's head went up at that; he thought he
was to take a walk to Lindenhof, and that would
be fine. But his mistress had forbidden him to go
away to-day. He looked at her questioningly; she
said nothing.</p>

<p>"Well, get your bundle and we will be off," said
the visitor.</p>

<p>Renti looked up with wide eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you mean&mdash;to live?" he said at length,
hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; that's what I mean," she assured
him.</p>

<p>A look of joy shot into his eyes that touched the
woman's heart.</p>

<p>"How glad he seems to go with me!" she thought
with pleasure.</p>

<p>Renti darted away to fetch his bundle, and in a
very few minutes was back with it; he had little
to pack.</p>

<p>"There is nothing more to arrange, I think," said
the visitor.</p>

<p>"Nothing," answered the hostess shortly. "I
wish you joy."</p>

<p>But the woman of Lindenhof paused. "Renti,"
she said, "don't you want to tell your master 'God
keep you'?"</p>

<p>"It is not necessary," said the other woman.</p>

<p>But Renti had been accustomed to obey his former
mistress on the instant, and when she spoke
he immediately ran to the barn. Returning in a
moment, he made his adieus to the wife. They
were short; she did not desire many words.</p>

<p>Then Renti walked along beside his old mistress
toward Lindenhof. He was making the journey
this time with a clear conscience, and before him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
lay the prospect, not of a few anxious, homesick
hours, but of the old happy life. He was to stay
there, live there, be at home once more in the dear
place. He could hardly realize such happiness.
Every now and then he would look up at the
woman to see whether it could really be true. She
was going her way silently; she was again busy
with her thoughts. So far the matter had turned
out quite differently from her expectations. Could
the boy be merely playing a part, she wondered,
and would he show himself in quite another light
when it came to working and doing as he was told?</p>

<p>There was nothing saucy, nothing obstinate, nothing
uncanny about him, so far as she could see. He
seemed to be just the same cheerful, willing little fellow
that she had always known. But his blouse was
very shabby and his little trousers most disreputable
looking for Sunday, and his whole appearance was
not clean and well kept, as it had formerly been.</p>

<p>"Renti," she said, looking him over, "are these
your Sunday clothes?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered, blushing; "in the bundle I
have only torn ones. I have been wearing these on
Sundays and week days, too, for a long time."</p>

<p>"That blouse looks to me like the very one I
gave you for your Sunday suit. Have you had
nothing new since then?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, this is all I have," said Renti meekly; for
he thought the woman was displeased with him for
the way he looked.</p>

<p>"It is not your fault," she said, noticing his
embarrassment. "But now, Renti, you mean to
obey me, and to do what is right, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; indeed I do!" said Renti, smiling up
at her with the old honest look in his face. His
words, too, sounded so hearty and natural that the
woman could only wonder more and more.</p>

<p>When they came within sight of Lindenhof Renti's
eyes sparkled. "There is the roof!" he cried. "Do
you really mean that I am to stay here again?"</p>

<p>"The staying depends very much upon you, Renti;
but if you walk so fast I cannot keep up with you."</p>

<p>The boy could hardly hold back his steps as they
approached the house. Suddenly he asked: "May
I run up to the alder meadow for a moment? I will
come right back."</p>

<p>The woman looked at him sharply. "Renti," she
said, "you aren't thinking of running away already,
are you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no; I am here now, you see. Where could
I run?" he said with a happy smile.</p>

<p>The woman shook her head as though she did
not understand. "What do you want in the alder
meadow?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>"Only to run over and tell Gretchen about it;
then I will come right back."</p>

<p>"Then run," she said in kindly tones; but it all
seemed most extraordinary to her.</p>

<p>Renti ran as fast as he could. Gretchen was
still sitting on the wall, but she looked sad, for
she thought Renti was not coming; perhaps he
was in trouble again.</p>

<p>"Gretchen, Gretchen!" she suddenly heard him
call. He was running toward her, waving his
arms in the air and calling excitedly, "Gretchen,
Gretchen! I am at home again!"</p>

<p>Gretchen had not the slightest idea what he
meant, but she ran toward him eagerly. When
they met, Renti was so excited and so happy that
he could hardly tell his story; he had to shout
aloud, turn somersaults, and leap into the air for a
while. When Gretchen finally began to understand
that Renti's old mistress had gone to get him and
that he was now to live at Lindenhof again, she also
broke forth into shouts of joy, and cried out again
and again: "O Renti! now we shall be happy as
we used to be. And you will be here for the herding!
Oh, I am so glad, so glad! I have been thinking
how sad it would be when I had to come to
pasture all alone, and you were far away herding
other cows. But now we'll be together again." And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
at the thought they both became so hilarious that
the neighboring hills entered into their joy and
repeated the merry shouts.</p>

<p>"Renti," said Gretchen suddenly, in thoughtful
tones,&mdash;she always was a meditative little Gretchen,&mdash;"why
was it that the mistress of Lindenhof so
suddenly took your part, when all the other people
said they did not want you because you were good
for nothing? It could not have been on account of
the work that she took you."</p>

<p>"No, I don't believe it was," said Renti rather
shamefacedly; "but I don't know what other reason
she could have had."</p>

<p>Then Gretchen said earnestly: "Renti, I believe
that God put it into her mind to go and bring you
home. I have been praying to him every day; for
though I saw no way out of your troubles, I trusted
God, and knew that he would find a way to help
you."</p>

<p>"Oh, there is something I have not told you!"
exclaimed Renti. "I kept my promise all the week
about praying away the bad words and evil thoughts
when they tried to arise, and kept saying over
and over,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i-1">"For if your faith be sure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And your courage endure,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">God will be your friend."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>
<p>"And see how it has come true! We trusted
God and he has given us our reward," said Gretchen
joyfully.</p>

<p>Now it was Renti's turn to look thoughtful.
Suddenly he said, "I hadn't thought of that before,"&mdash;for
he had been saying the verse merely
as a remedy against bad words and thoughts, without
thinking much about its meaning; but now he
began to understand that God was ready, if one
turned to him, to do a great deal more than one
really asked of him.</p>

<p>These meditations kept Renti very thoughtful
for a while; then he suddenly realized that it was
time for him to go, and he hastily bade Gretchen
good night and started down the hill.</p>

<p>"Good night, Renti!" she called after him happily,
and they went their separate ways.</p>

<p>As Renti neared the house he broke forth into
a loud, ringing yodel.</p>

<p>"That doesn't sound like a sneaking hypocrite,"
said the farmer's wife to herself, as she passed
through the garden. Before she reached the door
Renti was by her side.</p>

<p>"May I run out to the barn a moment?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I am willing," the woman answered.</p>

<p>Renti darted off toward the stables, and going
up to Brindle's stall put his arms about her neck
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>and said, "Brindle, dear Brindle, do you know me?"
And Brindle answered so lustily that all the other
cows joined in, and Renti received a welcome that
made the rafters tremble.</p>

<p>Then he went up to the hayloft, and from there
climbed still higher to the upper floor. Here he
scrambled around in all the corners, and when he
came down he had his cap full of eggs.</p>

<p>When he entered the kitchen the housewife was at
her usual evening duties. Seeing him she stopped and
exclaimed, "Where did you find so many fine eggs?"</p>

<p>"In the barn," said Renti with shining eyes.
"Look at these! and these! Here are Brown Betty's,
and here are Snow White's, and these are from the
speckled Bobtail, and these from the two young
hens. What fine ones!" And Renti laid them all
out on the table, as eager and interested as though
they were all his own property.</p>

<p>"Now look at that!" exclaimed the woman, viewing
the collection admiringly. "Andrew has been
telling me all along that my hens were not good
layers; and I always had the best hens in the parish.
The trouble has simply been that he did not know
where to look for the eggs. How did you know
where to find them, Renti?"</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="I203"></a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 50%" >
<img src="images/203.jpg" alt="Brindle, dear Brindle, do you know me?" style="width: 80%" />
</div>


<p>"I have always known," said Renti; "and I
know of other nests that I have not searched yet.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>I used to watch to see where every hen laid her
eggs. But now I must fetch the wood."</p>

<p>And he went eagerly to work, running to and fro
as swift as a weasel. He asked no questions; he
knew just what had to be done. When the wood
box was full to overflowing, he picked up the water
bucket and filled all the vessels to the brim. After
that he brought out shoe brushes and blacking from
a box on the floor, and seating himself on a little
three-legged stool in the corner, he took up the
shoes, one after another, that stood in a row by the
wall, brushing and polishing them with all his might.</p>

<p>The mistress looked at him, shaking her head
in a puzzled sort of way, and said nothing. Never,
since Andrew, the young hired man, came into the
house, had she been so beautifully served. She
had never complained, because she would have no
unpleasantness in her home; but now that everything
was being done so nicely, without a word
from her and without the clatter of heavy feet, the
woman breathed a sigh of relief and could hardly
keep from telling Renti what a load was falling
from her. But she did not want to spoil him. Yet
how was it possible that this was the boy whom
nobody wanted?</p>

<p>The farmer came home a little later than usual
that day. He was somewhat nervous, for he thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
his wife would be full of complaints about the boy,
and he did not want to hear them.</p>

<p>He was surprised to find, when he entered the
room, that she had not a word of criticism, and that
she did not look at all worried, and he sat down to his
supper with a little sigh of relief. Again he was surprised
to find how solicitous his wife was about keeping
the boy's plate filled with good things, while Renti
meanwhile was gazing about the room with beaming
eyes, apparently finding new delight in every detail of
the old Dutch stove, and dwelling on the gray purring
cat as the most beautiful object in all the world.</p>

<p>After supper the woman said, "Renti, you know
the way to your room. Your bed is just where it
used to be."</p>

<p>When Renti found himself in his own dear little
room once more his joy was complete, and he felt
like shouting and yodeling; but of course that would
not have been fitting, so he sat down on the edge
of his bed&mdash;for he was too happy to sleep&mdash;and
thought over all that had happened, and how it
was that he was back here once more. He recalled
what Gretchen had said, and he felt very thankful
that the dear God had come to his help as soon as
he had tried to do right.</p>

<p>Downstairs the man was saying to his wife, "He
is not so bad as you expected, is he?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>Thereupon the wife broke forth into such expressions
of joy and praise that the man listened in
amazement and finally said: "Be on your guard.
There must be something wrong about him, and
you will probably discover it soon enough."</p>

<p>The wife said she would watch the boy carefully
before she put her full trust in him. Her worst fear
was that Renti had fallen into bad company and
had in that way learned to run away, and that he
might be misled again. She determined to keep him
at home altogether for a week, so that she might
know what he was about.</p>

<p>Monday came; from morning till evening Renti
ran about, here and there, from one to another,
helping now the farmer, now the wife, now the
hired man. He knew just what was needed and
what was to be done, for he knew the orderly,
systematic work of the place, and was everywhere
apt and as quick as a flash. His whole heart and
mind were in the work, for he loved the dear
familiar tasks; he was at home once more.</p>

<p>It was the same on Tuesday, on Wednesday, and
on Thursday. The farmer seemed to have four
hands; his work was done before he knew it. When
he needed help anywhere Renti was immediately
beside him, even before he called, ready for the next
step in the work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>On Thursday the hired man said to his master:
"I'd rather get along with just the boy. He is
three times as quick as Andrew; he knows the
work and is always willing; and even if Andrew has
the advantage in strength, the little fellow makes
up for it with his good sense and intelligence."</p>

<p>This was exactly what the farmer wanted; but he
had been holding back to see how the boy would
turn out, and whether he would show any bad tricks.</p>

<p>When the farmer spoke to his wife about the
matter, she exclaimed: "Thank goodness! Now I
shall be rid of those clumping feet in my kitchen.
When I have the boy alone with me I feel as
though I were in heaven."</p>

<p>But she had not yet satisfied herself in regard
to the boy's companionship. So one evening when
the other servants had gone to bed and the farmer
was busy about his last duties in the barn, she
called to the boy to come and sit down beside her
at the table; she wanted to have a serious talk
with him.</p>

<p>"Now be honest, Renti, and tell me where you
used to spend your time when you ran away and
went tramping. Tell me just exactly who was
with you."</p>

<p>Renti was a little frightened to have his evil days
thus brought up before him, and he said in a meek,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
penitent voice: "I always ran straight home, back
here to Lindenhof; and then I would sit out behind
the barn, or I would go into the shed sometimes,
when no one was looking, and would coax the hens
to me. I used to stay with them a long time, and
sometimes I climbed up in the barn where I could
look down on the cows."</p>

<p>The woman scrutinized the boy closely without
speaking. She knew he was telling the truth. Finally
she said, "But, Renti, why did you never come
in to see me, if you felt so?"</p>

<p>Renti hung his head and said: "On Sundays,
when I might have come, I had been running away
all the week, because I could not keep away from
here; and then I thought you must be angry
with me."</p>

<p>Now the woman began to understand her little
friend. It was out of pure devotion to her and her
house that the boy had fallen into evil ways. She
must make amends to him; she was touched by
the discovery she had made. What a load he had
taken from her! She need fear no bad companions,
no tempters, who would come after the boy to lure
him away. Trickery and hidden malice were out of
the question. And now she might dismiss forever
the dread of having to send the boy away, thus letting
the woman of Stony Acre triumph over her and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
giving the other women a chance to express sympathy.
Best of all, though, was the thought that she
was going to have the nimble, happy, devoted little
fellow to serve her again. She had always liked
him and now felt more attached to him than ever.</p>

<p>"Renti," she said at last, with a voice full of
emotion, "you must have no more fears. As long
as I am at Lindenhof you shall have a home here."</p>

<p>A happier boy than Renti was that night could
not have been found in all the parish of Buschweil.</p>

<p>And the farmer was so glad at the turn things
had taken, and the way in which his work was being
done, that he would stop in the fields to tell people
all about his wife's wonderful achievement in making
a model boy out of Renti. The hired man, who
had always found Andrew too clumsy to be of much
assistance, heard with satisfaction that the little
fellow was now to be taken instead, and he went
about telling people that his mistress had but to
look at a boy and she could do anything with him.</p>

<p>So, before another Sunday came, everybody in
Buschweil had heard the news and was talking
about the way Renti had been reformed in one
week. It sounded so improbable that most people
rather doubted the truth of the report.</p>

<p>But the mistress of Lindenhof said that they
would see on Sunday that she was not afraid to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>appear with her boy. She fitted him out with new
clothes from head to foot, finishing off with a little
black cap that set off his bright face and dancing
eyes most jauntily.</p>

<p>As Renti walked home from church beside his
mistress, many a head was turned to look after them.
"Can that be the boy whom no one wanted?" said
one. Others said, "No one else in the world could
have accomplished what she has with the boy." And
all seemed pleased with her success.</p>

<p>The woman of Stony Acre alone did not care
to talk about the wonder that had been wrought
at Lindenhof. She walked straight home without
once looking round. The other woman also went
her way; she did not care to boast, or to be flattered
for what she had done; she merely wanted
people to know that Renti was not the good for
nothing that they thought him. He should have
his good name back, she said.</p>

<p>On the way home she fell in with the family
from The Alders. They had heard the news and
greeted Renti pleasantly when they saw him; but
Gretchen was beaming with joy to find that he was
now one of the very best looking boys in all the
parish, and to know that, being part of a well-ordered
household once more, he would henceforth
come to school and to church regularly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>
<p>Since that day the lessons in Sunday school have
had a new interest for the little girl. She has found
out that the verses she learns may be of great help
and comfort if one will try to think them out; and
sometimes, when she is called upon for her old
verse, a particular earnestness comes into her voice
that makes some one mother say to another, as
they come from church: "Gretchen's verses to-day
did not sound like a mere recitation. It seemed as
though she were saying the words especially to me,
and for me, to give me comfort."</p>

<p>To Renti the words bring many memories that
make him thoughtful and at the same very happy.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
